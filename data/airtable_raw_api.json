Gu$, I won't go into all the details of what they do since you already know how they are helping other defense tech companies deploy their DoD software in Air Gap environments, but here are some notes on our call.\n\nIt looks like Rebecca was already chosen as an SME so we spoke a little bit more about what representation for her company would like like on the competition side.  They will allocate one or two other people to represent the company in the competition and Rebecca will not be allowed to be an SME in their pods that week to keep it fair.  That being said, she's on board to get their company representation to compete and just had some questions about the downselect process, so I walked her through how the competition takes place and what's to come in the mastermind phase.\n\nI asked her to walk me through the tech a little to understand what they've done, and their tech, team, funding, and traction makes them a great (maybe even overqualified) candidate to compete.\n\nIn short, recommending for invite.\n\nWhen they commit, it will be under a different name than Rebecca's for competition, and we'll get those details once they receive their invite. ",
      "Answer 1": "Hey, good morning. To start, definitely not Rebecca Lively, as you can probably already tell Drew Belk, one of her partners in crime here at Defense Unicorns, but did want to address that elephant in the room before answering the question. So what problem does Defense Unicorns solve? It's really simplifying the software delivery life cycle from initial deployment all the way through upgrades from cloud environments to on prem environments to tactical edge environments. And the way we go about solving this problem is by building a software delivery platform that serves as the foundation and answers a lot of the complicated parts of the process like ATO controls, building out the baseline as code so that it's repeatable and portable and movable. We've actually focused a lot of our R and D efforts on air gap deployments. So getting to these hardest, most constrained environments and we see this as the main enabler to getting those software capabilities into the hands of war fighters. The problem I addressed because of our time active duty. So I personally served five years while I was in I worked multiple different software acquisitions. The first one was many years in lots of millions of dollars and never made it into production because it couldn't get authorized. It didn't make it through the ATO process. Second one, I now armed with that information say hey, I can figure this out. Figured out that we need to start with the ATO process in mind to begin with. But they didn't follow best user centered design principles and practices because they didn't have access to users, they didn't have the tooling to do. So so again, years, millions of dollars gets deployed, nobody uses it. So really what we're trying to get at is solving that problem by providing the tools that enable the people, the processes, the culture to go get after getting the right tools and capabilities into the hand hands of war fighters, making it easy to deploy with things like a single line command or tablet deployments, et cetera.",
      "Answer 2": "A little bit about our company talking through things like Traction from a revenue perspective. We're over $30 million a year in ARR at this point. A little over four years old as a company as far as awards go. A couple different contracting strategies. We have CBER authority so we can have direct sbirs. We have a couple of those with different organizations, as well as a GSA IDIQ vehicle that we can put out task orders on if people need that as a contracting option. That we have, I think six task orders awarded on right now. Major Traction has been in the Navy with Project Blue or PMS397, the Columbia class submarine, which is the Ohio class. Follow on. It's our largest mission hero or customer to date. Over $10 million a year in revenue. Second largest would be defensive cyber operations for the Air Force. A little over, I think, 6 or 7 million at this point. Looking to expand a little bit more over the coming months. So getting decent traction across those two services, as well as some initial traction within the army and Space Force. We were awarded a STRATFI last year. That's $5 million a year with space launch Delta 45, and have some initial work with the army that we hope will grow. From an employee's perspective, we're at about 140 now, and funding wise, we closed a Series A about this time last year for 35 million.",
      "Answer 3": "How government ready is our company. We work explicitly with the Department of Defense and government agencies, so we have a CAGE code, we have an fcl, we have lots of cleared employees. We have multiple different contract vehicles I mentioned in the last video. We have direct CPR authority from some of our open source technology. We have a GSA contract vehicle. We're on the Trade Winds and P1 Solutions marketplaces. We're also listed in AWS Marketplace and are working through the Azure process as well. So multiple different options with the goal of making it easy for our mission heroes. As I mentioned before, government customers to work with us in whatever way works for them and the way they're structured from a contracting perspective.",

      "Phone Interview Notes": "The venture developed a logistics platform with AI and ML built in.  This is a crowded space from our interview so far, so I was looking for key differentiators, and I found them.  First, the company received a seed round of 15 million from Defense Tech VC's.  That stood out to me so I asked how they were able to get that much, and he elaborated that their co founders and core engineer team were part of logistics companies for Palantir, Amazon, and Google that all dealt in this space.  They've only been around for 8 months and have made quite the amount of traction with biz dev and demos to the right people.  They're getting a lot of feedback from PEO's that they are for more mature than other companies demoing this type of software in their space.  They were just awarded their first SBIR after only 8 months in business, they have a team of about 20 mostly focussed on engineering, and their founders have previous exits in this space.  They are solely focussed on going after DoD first then the commercial space.  They have basic gov readiness and multiple members on the team have TS clearance.  Much of their time over the next year is allocated towards getting their ATO, and they are well on track to have their fedramp cert in that time as well with alot of support from AWS and Palantir.  Recommending for invite. ",
      "Answer 1": "Hi, I'm Shalia. So what Gallatin is building is a software platform for defense logisticians to prepare them to be able to move at machine speed. So at the core the problem is a lot of the way we plan military logistics today. And I know this, having been a battery XO in the active duty army, is revolved around ERP systems and, and then after those ERP systems there's no purpose built software. So what you have at the lowest echelons or voice and things written down on paper, at some point that gets translated into whiteboards and at some point that gets translated into Excel and PowerPoint. The way we plan on solving this is really, I think, three big steps. Step number one is creating an operating system that provides not real time, because that's not possible, but near real time visibility on supplies and logistics resources from the lowest level echelon in the military all the way up through DLA as much as we can once we do that. The second insight is to use all of this data to start doing predictive demand, right? So based off of what different units have and how they are expending resources in op tempo, can we actually use AI and to go and predict how much demand you have from all these different units all over the battlefield. And then the third insight is, hey, if you get really good at predictive demand, the idea is to start also predicting supply demand pairings and create like a machine speed supply web. Think if I've got a unit at the tactical level with XYZ demand and I've got a source of supply and trying to move that supply somewhere else on the battlefield with X and Z, or automatically planning the optimal match of that supply and demand and thinking about the route in between, actually get it there. Thank you.",
      "Answer 2": "So when I think about Gallatin's traction, I think about four big buckets. One in terms of the employee base, our employees come from some of like the biggest successful startups in the defense tech space, as well as in the commercial sphere overall. So we've got a bunch of employees that are ex scale AI Fed, ex Palantir Fed, as well as ex Amazon, and folks coming directly from the DoD and IC. On the funding side, Gallatin is being incubated directly out of eight vc, one of the leading defense venture capital firms. And in terms of early traction, we're going to announce two really big signature partnerships next month with some of the leading systems integrators and tech players in the defense tech space. So really excited for things to come, and we think Sigma Blocks will be a big part of accelerating that traction.",
      "Answer 3": "So we're really in the process, having been incorporated for about seven months, of going zero to one in the federal space. So we've got a UEI, we've got a cage code. We have submitted three SBIRs over the past couple of months, waiting to hear back. We've got a bunch of cleared employees as well. And then with these partnerships that we're working on, that's going to give us significant access to a bunch of contract vehicles. Kind of big next steps we're looking for in terms of being government ready. As soon as we get those first couple of sibbers, focus on getting that tsfcl, get the software accredited. It's built in an environment that is IL5, but you need a contract in order to get that sponsorship for that accreditation, and then get on a couple of more contract vehicles is kind of the things that I'm focused on. Over the next six months.",

      "Phone Interview Notes": "The venture built a generative AI platform for de-risking supply chain which is applicable to both DoD and private sector.  The company was founded from those working on the derisking side of things from government and as they transitioned out of their gov jobs, they built this for gov and DoD to use.  With just a small investkment of about 600k, they've built the platform ready to use and are already generating over 10M annually with 930M secured in contracts over the next 10 years.  That platform itself muses data points instead of just data sets to de-risk supply chain including suppliers, investments, but most notably foreign investments in the supply chain.  They've patented naming languages to mitigate the risk of foreign investment in any supply chain and received a sub contract to do so for a prime.  Much of this is mandatory on the gov side, but on the dual use side, they are working with US buyers to show any threats in their supply chain up to 5 years taking into account many different data sets including those that are happening in foreign governments that might put the supply chain at risk.  They're also de-risking investment supply chain.  They're also workin on an initiative for offenses supply chain to ensure that the US is putting it's supply chain in the areas around the world that will make our national defense stronger.  The TRL level is at a 7 looking for more wide spread use, The founders have YS-SCI clearance to be a part of necessary briefings, and they have 2 current contract vehicles to do business.  They continue to broaden their team with UI/UX designers, software engineers, and go to market personnel.  Strong recommendation for SigmaBlox as I think they'd add a great element to the community and be meaningful to our stakeholders.  ",

      "Phone Interview Notes": "Booked for 3/4/25 @ 1130 EST\n\nThe venture used image a technology protected by 55 patents for image scanning of parts, weapons, and luxury items/high end collectable art for their dual use case to identify forges, frauds, and fakes as well as increased productivity.  Their current clients use their software in the luxury field to identify forgeries in the high art world and luxury industry, and they've adapted that tech to work in DoD.  The examples they have now are reducing fake processors/boards being used in DoD applications as well as reducing the time it takes to inventory and distribute their parts.  Aircrafts, weapons, and other applications fail when a large amount of fakes or imitation parts make their way into the supply chain process.  Using their imagery tech, they've been working with primes like GXN to identify these parts so they are not used in critical missions.  The company was funded with $34 mil and currently generated north of 5 million per year in Luxury, DoD, and with the FBI art crimes division.  They have UEI, Cage Code, multiple phase 2 SBIR's and a contract vehicle.  I think they'd make a great addition to the tech ventures for SigmaBlox and I'm recommending we extend an invite. ",
      "Answer 1": "DOD has significant problems with inventory management being streamlined or not. And then cfsi, counterfeit and fraudulent suspect items entering the supply chain. Which means that at any point in time parts could be lost or unidentified fake parts can enter the supply chain or fraudulent parts of another type can enter the supply chain and create tremendous cost issues, risk issues to both reliability of mission and lives of warfighters. For example, in the last 24 months the US Air Force and Lockheed Martin have lost a million parts of the F35 program. A million parts. Think about the effectiveness from a financial perspective that that brings and reduces and think about what that means to mission reliability of the F35s. Fake counterfeit boards were introduced. Cisco boards were introduced onto F15, F18, P8 Abrams tanks and installed there. A pilot on an F16 was killed when his ejection seat didn't open a parachute after the ejection out of the plane because the chip on the seat that was supposed to open the parachute was fake. What we do is we provide the dod or we can provide the DOD a fail safe simple way to ensure inventory management is streamlined and that no fakes or fraudulent items are even used intentionally or unintentionally. We do that by basically fingerprinting things. We have a machine vision technology that we developed that allows the DOD at any branch and at any level to image with a standard industrial camera or even a mobile phone image an item and no provenance from its source. Is that the computer board I thought it was when it was sent to me to this base? Is this the rifle from my arms room I just handed out to the soldier and I'm now getting back. So basically the ability to manage inventory correctly all throughout the system.",
      "Answer 2": "Aletheon is a proven dual use technology. We have commercial customers both in Europe and the United States in industries such as luxury goods, automotive, collectible transportation, healthcare, etc. Our revenues are in about the $5 million range. We have investments to date since our start in 2017 of $34 million and moving towards profitability in the next 24 months. We have won awards such as Times best invention in 2023, best optical AI solution in 2023. We've also been identified by the London Bullion Exchange, the lbma, which is the world's gold market, as one of a few technologies allowed to authenticate industrial gold going into banks. And we're the only US company to actually have that approval. Our patents or IP was all developed in house in Bellevue by our team. We don't use anyone else's over 55 issued patents around our technology to protect it. The team is about 23 people, almost all of which are in the Bellevue, Washington office. We do have a few folks in Europe to serve our European customers and we have a few folks on the east coast, but for the most part everyone is in Bellevue, Washington. And we actually do come into the office every day and we enjoy working with each other. Other than that we're ready to do and go into dod. We have a few phase twos happening right now.",
      "Answer 3": "We are government ready now. In fact, we have two SBIR phase twos going on right now, one with the US army and one with the Air Force. We are deployed on AWS's GovCloud so that from that perspective, deployments can be simple and easy. We're also able to do an air gap system, which is closed off from the Internet, and we've done that with the army as well. We have our uei, we have our cage codes. We have all of that in place. Of course, that's how we're able to do the Phase Twos. We also have a prime partner that is both an advisor to us when it comes to the Phase Twos and entering the military or DoD, but also as a contractor in terms of putting together our system and integrating it into existing military systems. Their name is GXM. They're based out of D.C. and they've done a lot of work with all branches of the military in integrating new technologies in there. So we are ready to go today and are able to do both siber types of agreements, but also more robust phase 3s and ongoing contracts in order to allow the government to take advantage of our technology and ensure streamlined inventory and no counterfeit or fraudulent items enter the supply chain."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "3/13/25- call booked for 3/14/25 at 14:00EST\n\n3/14/25- This company has developed a groundbreaking technology that enables real-time 3D visualization of the world, enhancing decision-making across industries. Their solution is also scalable to a micro level, making it particularly valuable for surgical applications. They have secured $50 million in non-dilutive government funding while also generating $10 million in commercial revenue. With a team of 25 full-time employees and 10 contractors, they focus 80% of their resources on advanced software development. Their chip technology is nearly ready for government use, with production set to begin later this year, while their software technology is ready now. They hold numerous patents and have successfully secured SBIR and DARPA funding. Additionally, they have the necessary registrations, contract vehicles, and experience working in classified environments to engage with the government immediately. Their biggest challenge is market awareness, not technical capability, making them a strong candidate for the next round. Given their advanced technology, traction, and readiness to scale, I highly recommend moving them forward.",
      "Answer 1": "Good morning, my name is Blair Barber, I'm with Photonics and we've built a very unique high resolution passive 3D sensing technology. Completely different than the standard stereo and other point cloud scenarios out there. We grab three dimensional surfaces as surfaces instantly where we're providing multi vector tensor per pixel. We've developed our own CMOS chip that allows us to now see basically vector data at every pixel. That's how we solved this first aspect.",
      "Answer 2": "We've developed tremendous traction. We've been doing military work for over 10 years. We now have a commercialization traction in both autonomy for autonomous robotic applications, including robotic surgery. We're getting into inspection digital twin, but also inspection of oil and rig type things and large vessels that we can actually inspect down to about 25 microns of resolution. We have a number of patents that have been extended out through the years where we keep enhancing those patents as we grow. So we've got extreme high quality web of patents that really are fantastic.",
      "Answer 3": "We have complete cage code. We have been doing RA government contracts. We've got multiple phase one, phase two SBIR contracts in the works right now with multiple different agencies through the years. And we have also started developing a couple of siting systems for the military and SOCOM contracts for passive ranging and passive range finding digital range cards. We're also looking at capturing digital scenarios for different kinds of simulation and training applications as well."

Extending an call invite to learn more.",
      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/6/25 - Booked call for 1/7/25 @ 1630 EST\n\n1/7/25 - Flybydev has developed the F-11 which is an American made Group 2 drone system.  It was developed keeping in mind of all the applications that could be used with a group 2 drone, and my understanding is it's \"open source\" capabilities are better than any foreign drone systems that are made out there.  They are ready and willing to do business with defense and need the most help navigating their gov ready levels.  The have a CAGE code right now and no one on the team has security clearance yet as it hasn't been needed.  They have good commercial traction using the F-11 for not only surveillance but detecting conditions in an atmosphere.  They're working with gas and power companies and have even done tests to surveil for law enforcement by applying detection cameras on the F-11.  It also has payload capacity up to 5 pounds to remove threats or carry applications developed by 3rd parties.  I'm recommending them for an invite as I think they'd be a good fit and able to collaborate closely with anything developing applications for drones such as cyber security, weapons, surveillance, or other various missions.",
      "Answer 1": "Hi, my name is Kat and I'm the co founder of Flyby Robotics. We are building American made drones as platforms for machine learning. So we got started on this venture in 2023 and we were kind of working on a couple of different use cases where we were building things on top of drones. And we realized one, all these drones that we're using, they're Chinese made, they're getting banned, there's this huge need for American made hardware, and two, no one's really building a drone as a platform for developers. So if you're a developer that's building stuff on top of drones, whether that's in defense or commercial, you're frustrated by the lack of programmability, adaptability, configurability, and especially the lack of edge compute that's available on drones today. So in early 2023 we kind of started looking at putting something like this together. Shared a couple of specs on a pilot forum and were really quickly overwhel with pilots from use cases across commercial and defense saying we really need this, like we want to build this. And so that's when we started building the F11. So what the F11 is, it's a Group 2 UAS that's built for, on the commercial side, mostly inspection. So the type of drone that you would see carrying a big camera to inspect like power lines, solar farms, that sort of thing. And then on the defense side for tactical ISR. So what makes the F11 unique is that it is built with this totally open architecture around a very powerful GPU and that allows every part of the drone to talk to the GPU and the GPU to talk back. So what makes that really important to the warfighter is that you can write autonomy software that allows the drone to process everything in its flight environment and make decisions about how to fly and what to do with the sensor and what to do with payload and in real time. So it's a level of configurability and adaptability that's totally unique in its form factor and in its class.",
      "Answer 2": "Yeah. So our traction, we raised 7 million from investors like Mac Ventures. So the former mayor of Washington D.C. naval Ravikant, founder of Angellist, Balaji Sunivasan, the former CTO of Coinbase, and we've sold our first 150k worth of drones. They're actually deployed in the field with early commercial and kind of developer partner customers. And most importantly, we've launched a partnership with Palantir, who's used the F11 to develop and field an AP&T GPS denied navigation capability on the system. So what that means is the drone uses basically takes in information just from a sensor that's on it, like a downward facing sensor, and uses that to navigate just by comparing what it sees to a map of satellite reference imagery in its head. And we launched that a couple months ago. And so that's now available, that's available to the warfighter on the F11. Uniquely, at this point.",
      "Answer 3": "No security clearance. We do have a uei, we have a cage code, and we have, you know, some kind of early relationships in the. Early relationships in the DoD in a couple of different branches in the military.",

      "Video Notes": "1/23/25 - Venture for alternate nav has funding, traction, and gov readiness level as an active defense contractor.  Dual use. Extending an invite for call. ",
      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/23/25 - Booked call for 1/24/25 @ 1500 EST\n\n1/25/25 - Skyline NAV's venture has patented an alternative for GPS or any satellite reliant positioning services.  By programming the air or land application with their tech.  They're using it for UAV and UGV applications to avoid any complications with positioning the application by getting spoofed or jammed.  Right now, the company is funded by 1.8 million in investments and revenue.  They have active contracts in the public sector as well as current contracts with Air Force and NASA.  The tech is at a TRL 8, and gov readiness is at a healthy state with UEI, CAGE Codes, Contract Vehicle, IATT, and a current military contract.  The current CEO is active military in the Army National Guard in Massachusetts.  Outside of the monetized and contractual traction, he spoke about \"unofficial\" conversations he's also having with higher levels of gov and national security around their venture. Strongly recommending for an invite as I think they'd be a great addition to the mix and able to collaborate with other companies at the incubator.  They're also a strong candidate to showcase our ability to recruit.  ",
      "Answer 1": "Hi. The problem we are solving for is our nation's dependence on gps. You see, if you were to connect to a satellite for positioning and navigation, that creates all kinds of issues. An adversary can easily jam or spoof it. We can have issues with solar jamming and denial because of solar storms. We can also have the urban canyon effect. When you're surrounded by buildings and mountains, you may not have good satellite connectivity. So what we are doing is we are providing the warfighter and the commercial markets an alternative to gps. So simply by taking a picture of what's around you, we can automatically detect different features in the air. For example, when you're flying a drone on an aircraft, a downward facing camera can easily scan all the different features. Think of mountains, think of trees, think of buildings, structures, roadways, brush, et cetera. And we compare that with pre downloaded satellite tiles and we are able to give you a matchback. On the land we have a similar approach, although we are using different computer vision models. So as you're driving, we are taking in information to include buildings, structures, mountains from the ground. It's three dimensional in nature. And then we are matching them with satellite data sets to give you a precise location back. Now what we have done, which is really innovative and no one else in the industry has done, is we have made our software available for use on the edge through a software development kit. So essentially all our computer vision models can now be downloaded on the edge on a drone, aircraft, car, truck, et cetera. And the camera can take an imagery, compare that with pre downloaded satellite image and give you location back. So we are offering military grade navigation with no satellite. You see, there's no point connecting to a satellite when we can just simply scan what's around you and give you a location back. That's what skyline nav AI does.",
      "Answer 2": "We are very grateful for the support we have received from our customers to include the US Military, but also prime organizations such as BAE Systems, Kierfort and many others who are actively using our product on the edge, on the ground and in the air. These organizations are leveraging our software capabilities for different mission critical platforms. Now we have also been able to use our capability and make that available to other smaller organizations. Think of emerging drone companies that are just starting out and so having our capability gives them an advantage compared to other competitors who may have been in this business for a long time. We have one issued and a pending patent and we are continuing to innovate with both our IP portfolio and our trade secrets. In terms of revenue and funding, we've been very grateful to have received over $1.8 million in funding, both R and D, but also commercial revenue from different customers that I mentioned. Oh and by the way, we also won the NASA Space Challenge. So we are also looking to deploy our technology on the Moon and eventually Mars in the next few to ensure the United States can win the next space race. We are a small team of 12 people, six full time and six part time, all American. We are based throughout the country. We are headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts in between Harvard and MIT and we're really grateful to the support we have received from our different customers and partners nationwide. We also continue to get traction from companies overseas and we'll be making those announcements shortly.",
      "Answer 3": "Many of the people on our team already have security clearances. I'll share my example. In addition to being the CEO of Skyla Nav AI, I'm also a US army officer in the Massachusetts National Guard and through that I have a TS clearance and many other people on the team have military and intelligence backgrounds and so we are able to leverage our security clearances for classified work in addition to CAGE code and DUNS and SEM and UEI and others. We already have that because we are an active defense contractor and we have received different contracts from the government, cbir, sttr, Phase one, phase two and now we are in the process of receiving some phase three contract as well. So. And one one other thing that I want to highlight is we are not just strictly a government focused contractor or a business. We also have commercial revenue, both from companies that are strictly in the aero defense sector, but also on the private sector side outside aerospace and defense. I'll share some examples of some car auto manufacturers who are leveraging our capability and we are in discussions to get our product in new cars that will be coming out in 2026 and beyond. So imagine the possibilities of working with a company like ours and we will be truly honored to be part of this program. Most importantly, we'll get to work with war fighters like myself and many others who will be in the program and really ensure our software capability is designed to meet their needs. Thank you for considering us.",

      "Answer 1": "Hi, my name is Krimail Defrawi. I'm the co founder and CTO of Confidential IO. We are a spin out from SRI International Stanford Research Institute in the Bay Area commercializing DARPA funded research on secure selective sharing of sensitive information. The problem we were solving in this DARPA program, which is called Brandeis, is to enable warfighters and DoD personnel to share sensitive information with portion markings in a way that allows them to share documents even if portions of them have higher level. Because the problem today is that let's say you have a document that has a paragraph that says no foreigner. The US Air Force personnel are with international allies and they would like to share the rest of the document which they could share, but they're prevented from sharing them because the whole document is classified as the highest level. So we solved this problem with Advanced Cryptography, developed a prototype that integrates with Microsoft Office and PDFs and images, and also automated the process so that now you can easily selectively share portions of documents and trace who's viewing which portions. Turns out that this has actually also applications in the last couple of years in the generative AI era, because as you're training language models, sometimes portions of these unstructured documents are sensitive and you want to basically prevent certain models or training workflows from having access to them. And as we're moving to the agents era, agents are also reaching into these documents and using them. And how do you have a unified flow that allows you to control which humans and which agents and machines have access to which portions of data and in a verifiable way trace that. So our platform does all this. It's very easy to implement. Its cloud agnostic can be deployed on PREM too.",
      "Answer 2": "So as mentioned we are a spin out from SRI International which is a well known research lab in the Bay area was the first node on the Internet. So there was 14 million in DARPA funding from multiple programs that developed the base underlying technologies that then were transitioned into Confidential. So there's already over nine patents that are exclusively owned by Confidential, which is my work out of Sri Lanka. Seven of them are already granted and two are pending. In addition we filed multiple patents under Confidential. We have very well known brands that are using our technology commercially in multi regulated industries like pharma and biotech, defense and aerospace banks. So we have things like Kiwi Kirin, which is a well known international pharmaceutical company. Oric, which is a well known large law firm. We have SRA itself, we have the NFL, we have other telecom providers also using us and we have things like AXA Insurance, the big insurance company we have phase two project was the Air Force was the Hanscom team to integrate our technology into a platform called Sabre, the Secure and Below Release environment. Secret and Below release environment. And we also have a lot of partners recently that we signed that are bringing our technology to different sectors, helping with implementing it and deploying it. In terms of revenue we are in the millions, over 2 million in2024 and projecting.",
      "Answer 3": "So we don't have any security clearances. The platform itself has been audited, it's containerized, can be deployed on any cloud and we're currently actually in an Air Force project deploying it on the AWS. GovCloud we are hardening the containers by working with the Air Force Platform 1 and using containers from Iron Bank. Commercially we've gotten a lot of accreditation. We have passed SOC2 PCI, HIPAA and ISO 27001. We are we got also a lot of awards by PwC Cybersecurity Solution of the Year in 23 and have a lot of traction as mentioned with the NFL, with sri, with with other defense contract we have won several contracts before as prime or as sub. So we have a uei, we have a cage code, we have an ongoing phase two sbir. We just heard of another with the Air Force. We have a new SBIR phase one that we just won with Navor, the Navy and we have a couple of outstanding proposals. We also performed on a project with ARPA H, the Advanced Research Project Agency for healthcare. So technology has wide applicability and we are ready to work with the government and as a prime or as a sub we have an ongoing relationship with things like Carahsoft and other defense contractors.",

      "Video Notes": "Generative AI security.  Good traction non gov.  Ok gov readiness.",
      "Phone Interview Notes": "The venture focusses on a VERY specific and niched type of cyber security.  The protect companies and entities against generative AI attacks.  This can happen anywhere on the network, individual or device level.  So, while a typical attack is already bad enough, any adversary trying to attack now is using generative AI to only become smarter and more personalized for attacks on networks, individuals, and devices on the networks.  This venture simulates those attacks to assess to readiness of any outfit, then arms them not only with defense for those attacks, but how those attacks will progress in the future so they are armed against them as well.  The company has A LOT of traction in funding and revenue.  They've received about 20mil in funding and are doing an ARR of about 3 - 5 million.  They have a team of 25 and looking to expand as they are in their go to market phase.  He said the tech is at TRL 5, but it sounds like it has a bit more use and could be higher.  Haldf of their revenue is coming from SBIR phase 2 grants. and the other half from the commercial space giving them a good dual use case.  3 members on the team have TS clearance, and they are in the process of getting the FedRAMP certification as well as their ATO.  They've been required to work out of classified facilities recently.  I am recommending them for an invite. ",
      "Answer 1": "Hello, I'm Sage Wong, CEO and co founder of Jericho Security. And since the launch of ChatGPT, unique phishing attacks have gone up over 1,200%. What does that mean? It means these attacks are no longer humanly scalable, and we've reached the nuclear moment for generative AI, and that affects everybody in the world. This is where Jericho Security comes in. Jericho's security mission is to defend the world from generative AI risks by simulating these attacks, creating unique educations to be able to educate people how to defend themselves, then ultimately selling defensive modules as well. I've spent my entire career in machine learning and summarization and custom algorithm creation, and this is a combination of the mission as well as my work background. Again, to protect the world from this new wave of generative AI threats.",
      "Answer 2": "We have 39 clients in our first year at market and just crossed 3 million in ARR. We have the CRO from Cofence who recently joined us. They are the inventor of the phishing simulation space from about 15 years ago and we've really taken a lot of the learnings from their trailblazing to be able to create a personalized scalable version. The original versions of these technologies use templates and library content to be able to educate people, but now at the pace that AI is moving, templates no longer are relevant. No one's getting Nigerian print scams anymore. The attacks are individualized and leveraging breach and dark web data. We use the methodology that the attackers use to be able to mimic their attacks in order to educate people and create the largest data set of generative attack tax in the world. We work with major clients like the US Air Force, Bain Capital, Wingstop, Jared and K's Jewelers amongst 35 others as well.",
      "Answer 3": "We are in the process of an fcl. We are in a SBIR phase two and then we just were awarded a tactical financing. We're working with CloudFit for higher impact level deployment of our technologies as well as working with a FedRAMP accelerator to be able to help make sure that our technology is ready to empower the warfighter."

They gave examples that this can be the weaponry on the aircraft from communications to either spot or fire on appropriate targets as well as coms to fly stealth or even basic 2 way coms.  As I continued to speak with them about what's most meaningful in their venture, it became really apparent that the tech wasn't even their most valuable part.  It was the speed in which they can do it.  Updating the tech on the aircrafts is a long dragged out process moving through program offices that takes anywhere from 3-10 years or more.  With the founder being a former Northrupp employee and their co founder a gov acquisitions expert, they've focussed their resources mostly on navigating the valley of death.  By this, I mean they are using their initial SBIR dollars and finding ways in compliance to use that money to get the tech onto the airplanes through the compliance in the specifics SBIR.  They've received 1.5Mil in SBIR then have been able to transition every SBIR into a line item with the right program officer to create meaningful traction in their venture and get the tech updated on aircrafts.  They work with a team of 10 right now, they have TS-SCI facility clearance to get in the right locations where they need to be to make this meaningful, they have multiple contract vehicles, and they're located in Oklahoma.  They seem very interested in the community element and helping other tech ventures navigate this valley between SBIR and Program Offices, and I think they'd be a great addition to the community for as much as they've accomplished in the short 24 months since being founded.  Highly recommending and invite. "

      "Phone Interview Notes": "Booked for 3/12/24 @ 0900 EST\n\nRescheduling\n\nThe venture develops application agnostic UI's for gov and DoD.  Gu$ is already in contact with their founder (who developed the UI for Apple's iPhone) and it sounds like the founder may be an SME for SigmaBlox.  Josh walked me through their traction a bit.  They're generating rev through about 12 SBIR's for a total of about $5 million, and they were funded with $10 million to start.  The UI they're developing is intuitive, advanced, and has been validated by several PEO's, but they mentioned the biggest problem they face isn't developing great UI tech, but rather the bandwidth for BizDev on the gov side.  I got to understand their use case pretty well on the phone, and was very impressed.  Won't go into to many tech details here as it sounds like Hadron is already well on your radar, Gu$, but I genuinely believe having representatives like Josh rom their company would contribute very well to SigmaBlox.  Not only for quality of the venture but their value to every other Defense Tech venture in the room that needs great UI for their tech.  I know the company has a big vision of a program office adopting their UI for all programs within, but that has been proven to be challenging for them.  This sounds like mutually beneficial alignment to have them represented at SigmaBlox to compete and I am highly recommending an invite.  They are on board to send 1 or 2 folks to participate in SigmaBlox.",
      "Answer 1": "Hi, this is Josh Van Buskirk, Director of operations with Hadron Industries. Hadron is a service disabled veteran owned small business and really the reason why our founder, Clay Dines, my boss, started Hadron, was to solve really tough problems for the DoD and to solve the user interface issue that is so often what we give our warfighters. As a medevac pilot, you know, Klee saw enemy action in Iraq. He also almost died. But the reasons why he almost died never had anything to do with enemy action. Because in the, uh, 60, there are really bad user interfaces. If he were to have ever gotten an accident, he's convinced that that accident report would say it was human error. And so, you know, because he had that experience and before joining the army, he was an MIT software engineer and worked for Steve Jobs on the team to develop the iPhone and the iPad. He said, hey, this is easy. I know how to make user interfaces. I did it for Steve Jobs. We made great user interfaces for teenagers. So let's invest in a company that focuses on building great user interfaces and has great technologists and great software engineers, mostly from mit. And he thought it would be really easy. But the challenge we ran into is that solving the technological problems, the easy part, creating great user interfaces is the easy part. It's the business development part that we really struggle with. So we're here to solve really tough problems and to make the warfighters interface with weapon systems and the technology that they use on a daily basis. We're here to make that easy. And that's the problem that we're trying to solve for the dot. Thank you.",
      "Answer 2": "So with Hadron, we've got about a dozen SBIR technologies. And as I mentioned in the previous video, we're really, really competent at building great solutions and writing great proposals, particularly during the SBIR process. So we've got a lot of traction with the Air Force. We worked with. We've been working with the Air force for about 10 years on a Minority Report system. If you've ever seen Tom Cruise in Minority Report when he searches through future crimes gesturally, or maybe Robert Downey Jr. In the Iron man movies, you know, we've been building that technology and things that derive and extend from that technology started with AFRL in 2014, then moved on to Air Combat Command, in particular the AWACS community. Now we're supporting Air Mobility Command, and it all derives and extends from that SBIR technology. So that's on the Air Force side. On the army side, we do tactical, the gamification of tactical radios, and that's with PEO C3T, command and control, communications, tactical. That's going very well. We did a phase one, a Phase two. Now we just started working on a sequential phase two, and we're hoping to transition to a phase three. So we've got a lot of great momentum, both on the Air Force and on the army side. And looking forward to working with Sigma Box to get even more progress. Thank you.",
      "Answer 3": "Yeah. As far as government ready, I think Hadron would can state very confidently that we are ready to go. We have an FCL at the collateral level and we are working to get a TSSCI fcl and our product in particular, Air Force product I mentioned in the earlier video that has been delivered to the intelligence community and also to Special Forces at classified levels. At jsoc, it was at the collateral level. With nro, it was at the TSSCI level. So we're ready to support the DoD in whatever way the DoD would like to work with us. But as I may have alluded to on the earlier videos, the real challenge we have as far as government ready is concerned is we don't have the. We don't have the bench of retired generals and retired folks from program executive offices. So in that sense, as far as government ready, we don't have the relationships necessary. We've got the technology, we've got the fcl, we've got the experience, but we don't have the institutional knowledge of the program executive offices and we don't have the bench of retired senior leaders that can help advocate for this product. We're primarily. Or products, excuse me, we're primarily relying on how great our capabilities are and how great our tools are. Not so much on a expensive sales staff. Thank you.",

      "Answer 2": "Infotron software suite has made a strong progress when it comes to traction so far. So first on the revenue side, we've had commercial contracts, we've secured an afworks Cibber grant, but we also subcontract with prime government contractors. We've been able to do that here and there and this has allowed us to contribute to critical operations in a real way. When it comes to innovation, we have three issued patents here in the U.S. including one international patent in Canada and we have a few others pending in additional countries. We've been recognized for our work by being named AFRL Cyber Warrior Week finalist. We've won a Goody Nation grant. We also were part of the inaugural Google for Startups in Atlanta. We've been a part of techstars LA Space. We were also named one of the top innovative CyberSecurity companies in 2021 and 2022. Our team is diverse on purpose, so we have business leaders, we have government experts, we have ex military people that have worked for NSA and Intel and at Langley Air Force Base. So that tells you a lot. And we also have so really great creative software developers. So they really bring a deep experience across cybersecurity. AI blockchain,",
      "Answer 3": "We've been ready, so we're actively engaged in supporting critical government initiatives already, even if it's on the local level. But we've already secured one Cibber grant. We're currently subcontracting with some Primes, which puts us directly in the mix of supporting mission critical operations. We built our solutions with government requirements in mind, aligning with standards like NISPOS Quantum Cryptography framework and ensuring compliance with cybersecurity mandates. Our team's background also gives us an edge. We have experts with experience in government ex military personnel, cybersecurity professionals who understand the challenges and priorities of working with government agencies. On top of that, we've established relationships with Delta 6, for instance with space Force AFRL in Rome and then on the commercial side, like mentioned before, IBM leading cities, and this has helped us navigate the government focused initiatives. We're not just ready for government work, we're already doing it and ready to scale to handle even larger opportunities."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "Booked call for 2/6/25 @ 0900 EST\n\n2/6/25 - The venture, Kinnami, came referred to us by SkyLine Nav who's already been admitted to SigmaBlox.  The venture builds a data mesh network specifically designed for UAV to transmit data autonomously to either command centers or peer to peer drones.  The co-founder explained it as rather than trying to transmit file by file, the software autonomously breaks up the data it's transmitting in multiple segments so that if any jamming or spoofing is happening, they avoid receiving complete data.  It also autonomously chooses the best and most network to transit the data.  The company received angel invest of 1M when they started and are generating about 2.5 million per year now.  They have one small SBIR with DoD.  Their commercial customers include Verizon and IBM.  Their team of 10 includes mostly software engineers and a few people focussed on BD.  The tech is at TRL 7 and they are subtracting with ARMY Core as well.  Theyve been spending a bit more time on government solicitation lately to get to TRL 9 with wide spread use.  Recommending them for an invite.  ",
      "Answer 1": "Hello, I'm Sajish Krishnan, CEO of Konami. Konami provides the resilient data infrastructure needed for distributed platforms at the tactical edge, secure mission critical data on platforms like satellites, drones and IoT, and enable the transmission of this data even in contested environments. This ensures mission success by getting the right data to the right person at the right time. Traditionally, almost all data processing has happened centrally in some sort of cloud or data center platform. But today, we're building a world that's increasingly reliant on data processing at the computing edge, on satellites, drones, IoT, and so on. Gartner estimates that by 2025, over half of all enterprise generated data will be paid and processed at the computing edge, up from just 10% in 2018. Now, there are companies out there like Google and Microsoft, that look to securely store image data in the cloud, but no one's seen that across a distributed set of systems at the practical edge. And this is where Konami uniquely plays. So to address this problem, Konami has built a software platform, Amishare, which is a distributed data management and security software platform that runs on all of these different edge systems. Amishare works by taking any type of unstructured data. So think about a video, a picture, or even a file. What we do is we break up that file into small pieces. Each of these pieces is then individually encrypted, and then we store and move these encrypted pieces into many different places across a distributed network. Breaking a large file up into pieces allows for better data security, but also for better data movement and network storage, and network optimizations as well. On the other end, when access to the data, these fragments are put together from the best available places at any given point in time. Using a meshare, you can now securely manage and store data on any platform, even if it has less physical security than the data center. So this is a critical application in many different industries, from space to transportation to critical infrastructure. So that's a brief of what Konami does. Thank you.",
      "Answer 2": "Over the past few years, Konami has progressed its concept from R and D to a working prototype that is now being piloted in both the commercial and defense sectors. On the commercial side, we're working with organizations like Valmont and British Telecom to solve problems around edge Data management in 5G, autonomous systems and smart cities. On the defense side, we're working with the Air Force as well as the Army Corps of Engineers in areas such as critical infrastructure monitoring, search and rescue and gps, degraded environments and software based multi level security. All of these problems that we're working on deal with managing and securing data in environments where network connectivity is challenged and physical security is also compromised because these are systems and devices operating out in the field. Konami generated about $2.5 million in revenues in 2024 and expect to double that $5 million in revenues in 2025. Our last fundraise was in 2019 when we raised about a million dollars in funding from angels and other private investors. And since then we have mostly bootstrapped our business. We have 10 employees in the company, seven of them are on the engineering side working on building and maturing our product. And then we have a couple of people on the sales and marketing side that essentially helping us to drive and accelerate our commercial and defense businesses. Thank you.",
      "Answer 3": "So Konami has been working on government related projects for the last few years. We have a CAGE code, we have a UEI number. We are also going through our facility clearance process. At the moment it's being sponsored by an Air Force customer. The initial clearance is going to be at the secret level and a number of employees within the company have already gone through their individual clearance processes. So we're hoping to get our clearance in the next month or two here. From a contract vehicle perspective we are on the Air Force's ABMS idiq. We are also on the Navy's Seaport NXG idiq. We've also done a number of SBIR and STTR efforts with the Air Force. These range from Phase one and Phase two projects and quite recently have also just been awarded a Phase 3 SBIR from one of our Air Force customers as well. So I think with the SBIR contracts it also enables us to be directly sole sourced by Gov users from a SBIR Phase 3 perspective. So hopefully all of that positions us well to engage from a a defense perspective and drive further innovation and warfighter benefits. Our data management platform. Thank you."

      "Answer 1": "Hi, I'm Danny Gershman, Founder and CEO of Radius Method, and I'm here to share with you about how we're transforming cybersecurity for mission critical environments. Because today, breaches aren't a matter of if, but when. Organizations in defense, intelligence and highly regulated industries are fighting cybersecurity war on multiple fronts. Air gap networks, classified environments and AI operations demand security that goes beyond outdated firewalls, VPNs and access controls. The reality, nation state AI attacks, insider threats and quantum computing are evolving faster than traditional security can handle. Lateral movement, supply chain infiltration and AI driven exploits are now the norm. And to stay ahead, organizations need security that's dynamic, deception based and quantum resilient. At Radius Method, we don't just defend against attacks, we restrict, deceive and neutralize them before they cause damage. Our cybersecurity ecosystem includes Landmine, a deception based security platform. This misleads attackers and isolates threats and turns your network into a battlefield they can't win. Socket 0 Post Quantum Zero Trust Networking Solution that ensures continuous authentication and secure communication even in air gapped and classified environments. It uses AI stealth traffic shaping models to further confuse the adversary. And Crystal Tower enables secure fabrication of software and data models ready to be fielded near and far. These solutions aren't just theoretical, they're already securing Air Force and Army networks, preparing them for post quantum threats in the next generation of cyber warfare. The future of cybersecurity isn't about just preventing breaches, it's about operating securely despite them. RADIUS Method is redefining how organizations defend. We don't just stop attacks, we make attacking your network an impossible mission.",
      "Answer 2": "We are a fully bootstrapped profitable company with explosive growth from 1.8 million in 2023 to 4.1 million in 2024. We secured a mix of DoD subcontracts both across products and services, proving our solutions are not just a cutting edge solution but also proactively defending against US defense networks. Today we're trusted by US Air Force, US army and DoD DoD innovation units through contracts we've also been awarded for PlatformOne Solutions Marketplace with our DevSecOps as a Service solution. We have a contract with GSA on the multiple award schedule making it easy for federal agencies to work with us. We have a top secret facility clearance ensuring we meet the highest security standards for classified operations. And we're also recognized by Tech Defense Connect for Socket Zero and and we were selected for the SBIR program for Landmine, recognizing us for both zero trust and deception based security. We built a team of an elite elite team of 17 engineers, program managers and security experts specializing in zero trust, post Quantum security and AI cyber driven defense. And with proven DoD contracts, rapid revenue growth and scalable technology, we're securing the future of cybersecurity and we're just getting started.",
      "Answer 3": "Yes, we are ready to do work with the DoD. We already have like as I mentioned, top secret facility clearance. We hold many clearances as individuals. We are registered in SAM.gov, we have a cage code and we have a few contract vehicles, both the Platform One Solutions Marketplace, the GSA mas, and as I mentioned, we have a selectable not funded sbir direct to phase two with landmine."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/14/25 - Booked call for 1/16/25 @ 1530 EST\n\n1/16/25 - Venture was one of the outside leads from Gu$.  Venture has built an RF emulator that is meant for deception.  At a TRL 7 right now, they've sold working $150k worth of working prototypes the the Third Infantry Division which is using this on their armored vehicles to replicate  a position of the vehicle in an area where they are not so they can move about without being detected.  I dug in asking if they'd be able to do the same thing with drone swarms, and he said the iteration would only take about 4-6 months to do that.  They've received several grants from various entities including AFWERX and have funded their company on those grants, as well as pitch competition won.  They are solely focussed on defense tech and have no plans to do anything in the commercial space with this tech.  They are far along in R&D to move the emulator to be ready for other applications, have a UEI, CAGE Code, Contract Vehicle, and spend all of their BD time soliciting gov.  Recommending for invite as I believe they'd be a great defense tech addition to the incubator and add to diversifying the tech verticals for the attendees. ",
      "Answer 1": "Hello, my name is Joseph Peterson. I'm the CEO and co founder of Spectrum Defense Systems. Our company specializes in developing expendable modular RF emitter systems designed for electronic deception training and jamming operations. Our flagship product, the Dynamic Radio emulator system or DREs, addresses several critical challenges. Initially, DRES was developed to replicate Brigade Combat Team because BCT electromagnetic signatures. Currently, BCTs lack an effective tool to mask their emission in the electromagnetic spectrum, which leaves them vulnerable to detection and targeting by adversaries. Now, over time, our product's capabilities have expanded beyond just BCT signatures to include a broader range of deception scenarios such as simulating various radar signatures. The DRES also fills a significant gap in electronic warfare training. There are currently no low cost expendable training aids available to simulate complex and contested electromagnetic environments effectively. The DRES provides a practical solution and enables more realistic and scalable training scenarios. Additionally, more recently, the DRES functions as a remote wideband jamming system. Unlike most jamming systems which require operators to be in close proximity and operating them manually, that makes them very susceptible in detection by targeting. Now the dreads can be operated remotely, which reduces the operator's risk and enhances operational effectiveness.",
      "Answer 2": "We founded Spectrum Defense Systems about a year and a half ago. Within the first year, we actually secured our first contract, valued at around 150,000, to deliver 15 emitters to the 3rd Infantry Division. In September, we had the privilege of showcasing our product at Vanguard, where it successfully replicated a radar signature at the White Sands Missile Range. More recently, we were awarded a Phase one Air Force SBIR contract, which will enable us to conduct further customer outreach within the Air Force and expand the deployment of our product to more warfighters. Remarkably, we have accomplished all of this, just the two of us, my co founder and I, starring the company while we were still in college.",
      "Answer 3": "We currently do not hold security clearances, nor have we held any in the past. We do have a uei, a code code and a contracting vehicle."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/28/35 - Booked call for 2/1/25 @ 1200 EST\n\n2/1/25 - Duality Systems is the strongest candidate I've seen so far in the resource allocation and optimization category.  Starting with funding, the company was funded with a 650k seed round then was awarded more than 2.7M in various SBIR DoD grants at Phase 1, 2, and another one even at Phase 3.  They have a team of about 10 people (most of which are service members who have transitioned out of service) and they are strong win the software engineers and data scientists.  For dual use, they are working with healthcare providers around the country on using their AI Resource Allocation and Optimization platform.  The tech is at a TRL 8 and ready to use for DoD applications such as satellites for space, space and air crews, air inventory such as drones, components, and hardware needed.  Their team of SME's and and Data Scientists includes several members with individual TS clearance.  The company has UEI, CAGE Code, and Contract Vehicle.  I'm not sure how groundbreaking AI resource Allocation can get, but they've made a lot of traction for what they are doing and have specifically tried to position themselves to serve the DoD with their AI Resource Allocation platform.  Recommending them for an invite as they exemplified a strong presence for the primary category they serve. ",
      "Answer 1": "Duality Systems is a team that focuses on solving complex scheduling and resource allocation challenges in mission critical environments like healthcare and the dod. One of the biggest problems that we address is the inefficiency, the bias and the manual effort that is typically involved in traditional scheduling processes. Whether this is from airfield operations, satellite scheduling, supply room scheduling for example, can lead to wasted resources, reduced operational readiness and of course burnout from the people are having to these manual intensive processes. Our flagship solution is Balanced Scheduler. We use proprietary advanced AI and machine learning algorithms to automate and optimize scheduling. Unlike templated or digitized manual systems, our solution balances organizational requirements dynamically with individual preferences and other constraints to create personalized, efficient schedules in a matter of minutes and a few examples, we have done both in healthcare and the defense sector. We have reduced scheduling times from UAV flight crews from 160 hours per week to just 15 minutes. This is an example of how we've recaptured valuable time and ensured that the personnel who are heavily trained and the resources that are allocated are put where they're needed most. So we improve efficiency and fairness. We help organizations reduce risk, save money, and of course increase their overall mission effectiveness.",
      "Answer 2": "Our company has made significant strides, particularly in developing and validating our technology. Though we've had our share of challenges, we've been awarded a number of SBIR grants through the Air Force and Space Force. So phase ones, a couple of phase twos and a very small phase three where our solutions have delivered those measurable results. Like, as I mentioned before, reducing scheduling times from 160 hours per week to just 15 minutes. But like other small businesses in the defense sector, we are always facing the valley of death, largely due to personnel turnover within the organizations that we've worked with. So that slowed broader adoption and longer term funding opportunities. In 2023, we got $650,000 in seed funding from the Colorado One Fund, which has been instrumental in fueling our growth. We've also started to form some partnerships with larger prime contractors like bluehalow, Colsa and intellibridge, all of which are promising to help expand our reach within the DoD. And those partnerships are growing. We know that that process is pretty slow. We have gotten excellent feedback from the military partners that we have worked with and those who've used our technology, which validates the value that we're bringing. But we are very eager for support to bridge that gap to long term program adoption and refining our GTM strategy within the defence ecosystem.",
      "Answer 3": "Duality Systems is a fairly government ready as a company. We do not have a facility clearance yet, but we are trying to work that with a current Space Force organization that we're partnered with, understanding that that might take some time period. We do have a UEI number, a cage code and we are registered on SAM.gov so we're we're within the process there. Additionally, we'll."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "The venture supplies modular robotic solutions for 3d concrete building capabilities.  Some of their applications include runway repair, underwater builds for reef management, base builds, and a dual use case for residential builds.  The entire system fits in a small container less than 20 feet, and uses materials off the beach or land to print so supplies do not need to be shipped.  The autonomous robotics have been used as a beach head for building the aforementioned applications with good proof of concept at TRL 8, but Bruce mentioned there are many more capabilities of the robotics that they will focus on down the road.  Bruce has founded several startups that have already worked with DoD, and he's partnered with the robotics team at Penn State for this particular venture which includes a team of 12 right now.  They are mostly material and robotics experts.  They're closing on a 4 million dollar investment round which they will use to expand to 21 people to facilitate their demand.  They've received another 4 million revenue from SBIR/STTR funding and done an additional 1.5 million in the commercial space over the past year.\n\nI think their venture understands the importance of gov readiness and the usefulness of what they are doing and how the DoD could benefit from works with them and vice versa.  With the applications being able to use multiple types of power sources, they'd be great to collaborate with some of the solar or power producers that are already a part of the SB cohort.\n\nRecommending for invite.

      "Answer 1": "XAB3D is a US owned construction automation company based in State College, Pennsylvania. Our dual use 3D concrete printing system directly supports the Department of Defense's forward air basing strategy on remote austere islands throughout the Indo Pacific theater. Traditional construction methods relying on large crews, heavy machinery and thousands of tons of material shipped across the ocean and simply can't meet the challenge. The logistics are overwhelming and the risks are high. XHAB 3D solution is a compact, mobile, self powered, semi autonomous 3D concrete printing system that fits fully assembled in a standard 20 foot container, deploys by aircraft, ship or barge, sets up in about an hour with only two operators. It's engineered to operate on uneven terrain and in harsh environments. The system is designed to extrude concrete for vertical structures, but can also be used for flat work, for example Runway repair with interchangeable end effectors. The arm also supports welding, gripping, scanning and more. It's designed to meet attla, Buy American and DFARS requirements. We've built and extensively field tested three Beta units, one with the Maryland Air National Guard with the objective of deployment in the Pacific Ocean island chains. Our core team has expertise in systems engineering, robotics and advanced materials and field construction. Penn State and its Applied Research Laboratory are R and D partners on SBIR and STTR contracts with us with DARPA, NASA, the U.S. air Force and HUD. We've designed our system based on the challenging military requirements that because if we can meet those from a performance and durability standpoint, then using that same capability for the commercial environment gives us a superior product.",
      "Answer 2": "After three beta versions and extensive field testing of our mobile 3D concrete printing system, we're transitioning from development to commercial sales this quarter. We closed the first tranche of our $4 million seed round in Q4 2024 and expect to close the second this quarter. We signed Lois with commercial customers for multiple sales of systems and secured customer funded demonstration projects across both government and commercial markets. This year we have multiple demos planned with the US Military. These include B huts for the Maryland Air National Guard and Air Force Northern Strike exercises, field barriers for the army at Fort Stewart and a storage facility at Osan Air Base in South Korea. The Marines have also expressed extensive interest in our system. Commercially. We're building houses for occupancy in Nome, Alaska and State College, Pennsylvania. We have $1.5 million in active government R&D contracts with DARPA, HUD and others, all focused on 3D concrete printing and advanced materials. Our 12 person team is scaling to 21 by year end. We hold exclusive IP licenses with Penn State, have filed our own patent applications and are building a strong IP portfolio in hardware, software and materials. We project cash flow positivity by Q4 2026 and $66 million in revenue by 2029.",

This is an older company, but was just recently acquired in the past couple years and revamped to service the needs of the DoD.  They're primary customer to date has been DHS.  While this is a bit of a saturated area, this venture seems to have way more traction and resources than any other I've talked to in their category.

Recommending them for an invite.",
      "Answer 1": "So the project that we're working on is really centered around the idea that the IC collects insane amounts of data, but hardly processes any of it. I believe it was General VanHerk who stated that a mere 2% of IC data is processed. So that is massive amounts of data that we collect that no one even bothers to look at. And to solve that problem, what we're proposing is essentially a multi agent tool that will connect to all these IC data stores and use its reasoning abilities to make links between different pieces of data, build out graphs, find relevant data anomalies, and help analysts much more quickly find the information they're looking for and able to build higher level synthesis of data and analysis rather than just munging through data all day.",
      "Answer 2": "So Ardent has been around for about 20 years now. We were acquired about two years ago by our current CEO Richard Zarek and when he acquired the company he wanted to grow our AIML practice. Previously the company had only been doing government contracting for digital transformation, geospatial intelligence, those sorts of things. So with this new venture that he's calling Technology Research Innovation Lab or trilab, we've been working to really grow this portion of the business. The current project that I've been talking about, the Multi Agent tool, so far we've submitted a white paper to AFRL ri. It was selected but not funded so there's some level of interest there. Currently no revenue or patents on this effort but we have been working on another effort that we have patented. As far as employees and funding, it's all internally funded by the CEO and the profit he makes he rolls back into the research lab. We've got in total about eight employees in the lab right now working to scale that up. Obviously as we continue to build traction.",
      "Answer 3": "We are very ready to work with the government that's our primary customer. I have a top secret clearance. We have a number of contracts that we work currently. We have a facility clearance. What else? Yeah, I would say we're pretty good to go as far as it's concerned. Most of our software we develop, we're working to make sure it's already approvable in terms of ATO before it even gets to that process. So we're very cognizant of being security and compliance forward to make sure that we can actually get stuff in the hands of users sooner rather than later."

      "Answer 1": "Modular Misfits is solving one of the biggest challenges facing the DoD today. How to integrate AI driven decision making at the speed of operations without the vendor login, security risks or data silos. For indopacom, where real time intelligence fusion across vast operational areas is critical, we deliver modular AI native data mesh solutions that enable secure federated AI processing at the tactical edge. The problem? Traditional architectures rely on centralized data lakes or proprietary AI models that introduce latency risk and operational blind spots. War fighters don't have the time for outdated information, analysts can't afford to fragmented data. Modular Misfits flips this paradigm, creating an AI driven integration layer that operates independently of any single vendor or database. Our federated AI approach allows war fighters and analysts to query and process data where it resides in real time without moving or duplicating sensitive information. Here's an example. Endopacon needs to correlate satellite imagery, SEGINT or in human or marine time domain awareness, tracking gray zone activities and responding to dynamic threats. Traditional methods require data transfer to central repositories, introducing delays and security risks. With modular misfits, AI native data mesh indopacom can run AI powered anomaly detection across multiple classified and unclassified networks in real time directly at the source, reducing the time to decision from hours to minutes. Our solutions built for interoperability, integrating seamlessly with tactical networks, cloud and edge compute environments like Platform One, Project Linchpin and the Army Ludros framework is what were originally complied with. This isn't just an idea, it's an admission imperative. Modular Misfits is building the future of AI driven decision dominance for indopacom and beyond.",
      "Answer 2": "Modular Misfits is a bootstrapped delivering results type of Right Now I have two consulting earning only $9,000 a month, far correct from where I used to be. But I'm also one full time employee, though I do have 15 contingent hires lined up ready to go once I do secure some funding through a contract. Beyond consulting, I've helped a company that I advise secure a direct Phase two contract customer memorandum submitting the bid tomorrow. And this is for Platform one. And that's why I'm a little bit seep, because I don't miss deadlines and I try to ensure that I push myself to the edge right at that edge before the cliff. But I'm not new to this game. At GDIT, I played a key role in a 22 billion dollar wind portfolio. By doing what I do best, I translate complex technical solutions into real mission impact. I know how to solution, I know how to win, and I know how to talk to customers to uncover what the requirements really mean. Modular Misfits is still in its early stages, but the foundation is strong. With the right support we're positioned to scale quickly and deliver AI driven data integration solutions that fundamentally change how the DoD operates.",
      "Answer 3": "Modular Misfits is a lean organization. When I left BAE Systems, I had a secret clearance. I think I was adjudicated for a top secret, but I've been unable to check that because I don't have access to J pass. I don't have a facility clearance. But Acoma is trying to work with me to get a sponsor to help me get to a facility's clearance. So I'm looking through for a vehicle to get me to that. I am registered in sam.gov I have a UEI number and I have a CAGE code. Right now I don't have any contracts, but because of the experience I gained at Udit, I built my solutions to be DoD ready. Things like hardening the containers, doing security scans to ensure that I comply with what I understand is going to be MMC v2. The other thing is that just the way that I write proposals, I understand how to talk to the government in a way that resonates with them. I don't try to give them a generic pitch or a copy and paste from another hundred proposals. I always try to write original content. I stumble over myself because I overthink things. But I'm hoping for the opportunity through an incubator like Sigma Blocks to get to achieve my dreams independently of another company."

Lovelace AI uses AI and ML to quickly aggregate billions or trillions of data points to predict a behavior of an outfit or individuals.  Examples of this could be aggregating what an adversary has done in the past and using it to forecast how they will continue to act so we can be prepared.  The companies co founders include former service members with TS clearance and former top Google talent.  They were working on a project for DoD that was shelved by Google before founding Lovelace AI to do it themselves.  They've received 7 Million in pre seed, are currently raising another 20 million in seed, have several SBIR's and are a part of the CRETA program.  Their dual use case of using the same tech with a simple UI to deliver the results has brought them over 7 figures in rev in the fintech industry as they continue to pursue gov contracts for their focus.

      "Answer 1": "So we understand from our experience in working in the ISR community that commercial space sensing is a great opportunity to relieve the burden from national systems when getting information that's good enough, may not be perfect, is good enough. So what we've done is created a platform that enables the warfighter, the people in the combat commands, people at the edge, to understand where commercial sensors are, what they can see at any given time, but more importantly, how to access the information they can provide. And then on the back end, we create layers of abstraction that turn that raw data into information that the end users can then consume at their place, at their level of connectivity, on their device of choice.",
      "Answer 2": "Regarding our traction we meet regularly with the U.S. marine Corps. We've kind of been working with their space Fusion intelligence group to kind of build our initial prototype around their use case. We've recently signed agreements with a large integrator and a medium sized integrator to be able to potentially create paths to integration for larger military and intelligence projects. We are also working with smaller companies that do deep research and deep tech regarding remote sensing like engaging hyperspectral sensors to do detection of harmful chemicals and byproducts. We are looking at using RF sensor phenomenology to do more bespoke tipping and queuing and multi integration which is a very problem problematic space to get at with national sensors. With all the functional managers in the commercial space we believe we are not bound by those encumbrances and we're able to move quickly to create new tradecraft with commercial sensors that have never been done before. So we're trying to break down the silos between these individual companies to create a highest and best use for commercial sensors.",
      "Answer 3": "Our prototype is very much government ready. We have, we're probably at a level 5, 6 from a TRL perspective. We do have a UEI number. We are regularly demonstrating our capability to former senior leaders. We have demoed this for people you recognize that have run federal agencies recently and that have moved on to get their feedback.

      "Video Notes": "1/9/25 - The venture is a sub contractor mostly helping contractors to defense.  They are working on a variety of defense tech projects but spoke briefly about some things they are developing internally.  Those are the things I'd like to hear more about because they are self funded, and the outfit is a good level of gov readiness with CAGE Codes, a contract vehicle, and security clearance. ",
      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/14/25 - Booked call for 1/16/25 @ 1330 EST\n\n1/16/25 - Their venture is based around developing drone and UAS technologies.  They generate most of their revenue by working as a sub for prime contractors like Boeing, Lockheed, and SpaceX right now.  They're generating over 2mil a year on that and hire specific contractors for each sub contract they are given.  They've been using that rev to further their internal R&D project of stealth drone propulsion.  This is the part of the venture they'd like to apply to SigmaBlox.  The stealth drone propulsion is mostly focussed around red teaming, able to go quiet and undetected to get information from the enemy's data infrastructure.  They are at a TRL 5 with this tech and able to iterate quickly.  They're looking for a prime under this mission and can iterate quickly getting it to a TRL 8 or 9 within 1 calendar year.  They've previously worked on the F-35 project and are structured mostly with contractors that have TS clearance to work on these projects.  Recommending for a invite to join us in Tulsa. ",
      "Answer 1": "So Sheridan Technologies is essentially an engineering and consulting firm. We provide full turnkey product development solutions, expert consulting and staffing solutions. We've been working with the aerospace and defense industries, developing medical devices, doing industrial automation, business AI automation and consumer devices for years. Some notable accomplishments. We worked on the F35 program to help contribute to the high precision avionics flight data recorder. Worked on some guided missiles, rockets, a lot of UAV drone type stuff internally. Well, let me get back to that. We worked to deliver a prompt prime contract to the US Navy for a bunch of computers Internally. We've been working on a stealth propulsion system, an AI recruiting tool that will allow you to find the top.001% of all candidates available. Rather than looking at a bunch of resumes, you just basically scrape the entire Internet for all the people that are looking for work, as well as an explainable AI that can also be used for war game simulations. We're really looking to work on some of our other programs and products internally and expand those to help the US and the efforts to promote American warfare. Thank you very much.",
      "Answer 2": "So Sheridan Technologies is very small company. I'm the only full time employee. The rest of the network is either contractors who are hired either to scale the business or as subject matter experts. Because that's kind of what we do. We go in there and provide subject matter expertise and consulting as well as contracting. Just hopping in there, putting butts in seats to fill those needs for businesses and primes. Typically, as far as revenue, we're primarily funded through the services model, although we are trying to move towards a product based model. No patents as of yet and no funding as of yet. So we're very small early stage startup, really trying to grow in the product development space.",
      "Answer 3": "How government ready is our venture? The venture already has a UEI number cage code. Let's see Duns number one contracts on SAM.gov and delivered on them. As far as clearances are concerned, some of our contractors do have their own clearances there. I co founded another company which has a facilities clearance so it's able to give people clearances as well and there have been talks about me getting a clearance through that. However, this business has been primarily focused on controlled unclassified information, so there hasn't really been a need for that. We have done some itard projects and ear 600 type work as well."

They are extremely relevant to their primary category and have impressive traction in the DoD space as well as a high gov readiness level.  The problems they're solving with quantum computing Ai/ML are all designed around resource allocation, and they have a steady track record of doing so in the past few years.  They're not building a thing for the military to buy but rather a service that the military needs.  The venture has received over 5 million in SBIR/STTR funding, but even more impressive is they are already taking on 6-8 prime contracts a year with the DoD.  I'd say they are a solid recommendation for this program and my ONLY area in criticism comes in their iteration speed around the venture.  While I think they can iterate internally on the tech needed for their contracts, they can be a little slow to hire new talent or expand upon their low hanging fruit on the BD side.  Ethan is leading the charge on the BD side right now and has the right contacts for the the prime contracts they receive, but doesn't spend much time outside his warm contacts to further diversify who they are doing business for.  They make a great \"dual use\" case by going after the logistics industry for the quantum software resource allocation.  They have steady revenue each year in the millions, and a solid team being able to deliver on all the contracts they are being awarded.  All in all, I think they would make a great addition to this accelerator and show that we can recruit top talent with traction and a high level of gov readiness.  ",

      "Phone Interview Notes": "Booked call for 2/3/25 @ 1500 EST\n\n2/3/25 - Stitch 3D's venture has been making geospacial imagery quicker to view for Commercial Industry and Dod.  They're able to work with drone service providers that use LIDAR technology to image an area and turn into 3D images that are multiple TB's then almost instantaneously  make them accessible to the engineering or ops team needing that imagery.  Their main differentiator to others that may be using similar providers is their data compression rates and more than 50 people can be viewing the information at once if needed as opposed to the tech limits others have where only one can view on the cloud platform.  The founder is an army veteran, and the company has received 1.9M in DoD SIBR/STTR grants as well as an additional 1.7M in dilutive funding.  For their commercial use case, they are working with drone service providers that use this technology to their oil and gas clients.  They have over 600 current clients on the commercial side and are raising an additional 2M to continue scaling.  The tech is at a TRL 9, they have UEI, CAGE Code, and a contract vehicle through their Phase 2 SIBR.  Recommending for an invite as they have a shelf ready product, good traction, and basic gov readiness.  They'd also make a good addition for collaboration in the room to other defense tech ventures. ",
      "Answer 1": "Hi there. Okay, so the problem that we are solving is essentially there is right now not a great way to transact 3D point cloud data intelligence on the web. Historically, what people used to do with point cloud intelligence is they would take the data, put it onto an external hard drive or thumb drive, and physically mail the data or ship the data to whoever the end client is. And this is because point cloud data is really large and really complex. Now, the intelligence you can gather from 3D digital data is fantastic. You can basically go into a building, you can see the terrain simulation. It actually has a lot of military use cases. In fact, LIDAR was created by the military in the 60s to look for missiles in the Cuban jungle. What we've done with the advancements with WebGL technology is basically allow users to now access point cloud data directly on a web platform so that they can essentially share a URL with somebody or invite folks via email to view a point cloud file right on the web. And this democratizes 3D data visualization down from the tactical end user to the operational and strategic intelligence analyst, and communicating between office and field work.",
      "Answer 2": "Okay, so in 2022, CIS3D was awarded a phase one SBIR and SCTR contract, which then became phase two SBIR and SCTR contracts. We took that funding and developed a prototype SAS platform for the Air Force to look at damaged runways out in the Pacific and over in Europe, whether it's from coastal erosion, sinkholes or you know, in the case of hostilities, missile craters, things like that. Since then we've transitioned that DoD development efforts into a commercial product which we launched in January 2024. The commercial product currently is being used by over 600 small businesses and medium sized businesses, mostly drone service providers, architecture, engineering, construction firms that are looking for an easy way to share 3D lidar point cloud data with their clients who might be in mining or forestry or departments of transportations, things like that. Current revenue is around $2,500 a month. We've been backed by 11 VC funds to the tune of about $1.7 million of pre seed funding. And we are getting ready to close our two and a half million dollar seed round. And in terms of other traction, you know, we were recently selected as a top 20 semifinalist for the TechCrunch Disrupt pitch competition in San Francisco out of over 3,500 companies and we actually made it to the top five. So. And we're getting ready to build enterprise features here in the next few months and start enterprise sales beginning in June.",
      "Answer 3": "Okay, so I was an Army Intelligence officer for seven years on active duty, transitioned to the Army Reserves and served as an innovation officer for four and a half years with his 75th Innovations command. My top sphere clearance is still active out through 2028 and we have received seven SBIR and STTR contracts. Five phase ones, two phase twos. Two of the phase ones are still active. Currently. One of the phase ones is getting ready to go for another Phase two proposal to work with the Joint Base Andrews Civil Engineer Squadron looking at doing point cloud and mesh conversion to document physical and real assets out at Joint Base Andrews. So with regards to how government ready is our venture, we have all the prerequisites in place. We have an active SAM registration cage code DUNS number ueid. So we're ready to get on contract through the SBR and SCTR programs. And we also are currently applying for an Army ERDIC Engineering Research and Development center cso which is looking at cold region domain situational awareness, looking at LIDAR data to help the warfighter in Arctic regions. Yeah, I think that's it."

He text that he is still in a meeting with customers.\n\n2/28/25- call booked for 14:00EST\n\n2/28/25- This company has been developing mission-planning VR technology for the past seven years, specifically designed to support warfighters. Their solution allows for detailed mission planning using highly accurate models, increasing operational certainty and reducing risk to soldiers. Through a Direct to Phase 2 (D2P2) SBIR award, they have enhanced their technology to proactively solve problems before they arise in real-world scenarios. Beyond military applications, their VR platform has also been used for disaster response, providing real-time updates to support logistical planning after events like hurricanes.\n\nTheir technology is ready for acquisition and implementation, with a TRL-7 core package as assessed by the Army. They hold intellectual property on their innovations and have secured $1.5M in SBIR funding, generating an additional $1.5M in revenue over the past two years. Their team consists of three full-time employees and 12 contractors, currently focused on customer acquisition and augmentation. While they have completed multiple government contracts, they are seeking strategic guidance on market entry to ensure they navigate the space effectively without disrupting industry relationships.\n\nGiven their proven capabilities, successful past performance, and the dual-use potential of their VR technology, they should be approved to move forward.",
      "Answer 1": "Our venture is virtual sand table and it solves the problems of mission inefficiencies. We solve this by digitizing the area of operation, bringing each individual from planners to mission participants into the environment so they can practice their mission virtually consequence free before they ever put boots on the ground.",
      "Answer 2": "We started around seven years ago with tiered units at Bragg, testing our belief that we can improve mission outcomes. We've had several intellectual property filings. We were competition finalists in Both Verizon built on 5G and shape AT&T shape challenges. We've had numerous pre deployment exercises and large scale exercises at home and abroad. We've had positive evaluations by our partner forces and we've had several contracts from Army Naval Special Warfare and a direct to Phase two SBIR with Air Force Special Operations Command and well, that was through AFWorks. Then we had a quick freeze during COVID Since then we've been regaining momentum, most recently with our assistance with disaster response in Western North Carolina as our mission planning tool does wonderful things. In addition to defense, we just wrapped up training with Civil affairs team from Fort Bragg and we are currently working with the UN for assistance overseas and also the Caribbean.",
      "Answer 3": "This is a fun question because you never really know what the next compliance hurdle will be. But I am tested and I passed for secret clearance, although the clearance is not housed currently. We have our UAI numbers, we have our cage code. We are on several contract vehicles, one of which is an 8A. We've been through the fun process of wide area workflow and have always been able to rise to the occasion of the next hurdle presented for compliance."

It communicates stealth with a basecamp to identify best routes, actions and avoid any routes or actions that could put them in danger.  From a venture standpoint, they've made alot of traction since they were founded a year ago.  They've raised over 500k in non dilutive funding, and are using resources from another successful tech startup they founded to fuel this.  They spoke about briefings in DC they've been a part of, partnerships with Google and Amazon Gov cloud that are offering teh tech support they need, and the founder seems to have alot of experience in navigating gov acquisitions.  They have UEI, CAGE code and a contract vehicle with individuals holding TS clearance.  They've moved fast since they were founded and they are Tulsa based which is a plus.

And that is or applies to both man made and debris.",
      "Answer 2": "Yeah. In terms of traction we're performing on our seventh United States Space Force contract. We've developed two notable component solutions. Our first is Delta which is patent pending and it takes sensor imagery and data from ground based or space based electro optical telescopes and determines what satellite that's in the field of view and also what it is doing in terms of localized motion. Our second is shock LEO or Super resolution Object characterization in LEO and there we take a single blurred camera image at far or near range and classify first do the detection, then classify with a a presented level of confidence. Which class of satellite? Our current team is nine, not all of whom are full time and are comprised of two PhDs, two PhD candidates and the others have or are working on completing their graduate degrees. We are bootstrapped and revenue generating. We have not yet orchestrated around and other than the founder only techstars is on our cap. Table.",
      "Answer 3": "Both of our component solutions have been containerized at various levels. One detector has already been tested on a flight ready processor and we plan to fly it and its algorithmic successor by year end to achieve TRL 9 for our delta. With some calibration or what we call tuning to the sensor, we are ready to ride sidesaddle with either a gravity ground based or space based EO government sensor or multiple sensors. Noting that we develop algorithms and software, not hardware, a reasonable integration period is expected to be deemed quote, unquote government ready. Thank you so very much."

      "Answer 1": "Infinite Composites enables customers to have the most efficient storage solution in the market with its linerless composite pressure vessels. This allows vehicles such as satellites, launch vehicles, spacecraft aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, hypersonics, and missile systems to travel further, faster, or carry more payload than traditional pressurized fuel storage systems. The problem that we're primarily solving is that the current state of the art solution is composite overwrap pressure vessels, or COPVs, use a metallic or plastic internal structure to serve as a tank shape and gas barrier. These internal structures, or liners, add unnecessary weight, take up valuable storage space, and reduce overall vehicle efficiency. And we solve this problem by optimizing the fuel storage system, eliminating that need for a separate liner or internal structure. And we do this through our developed patents and trade secrets and in materials and manufacturing processes that help reduce costs, lead time, and increase vehicle efficiency.",
      "Answer 2": "Infinite Composites has gained significant traction in the market through a variety of metrics. The company has been awarded eight patents with additional three patents pending. We've developed a variety of technologies to enable high pressure fuel storage such as hydrogen at 700 bar or 10,000 psi. We've even accomplished this in conformable shape design so not just your traditional cylinder shape but non cylindrical shapes. Infinite Composites also demonstrate our ability to store cryogenic fluids as well. We've also been able to achieve flight heritage in multiple tanks with tanks flying in geosynchronous orbit as well as hypersonic flight vehicle demonstration. We've served more than 30 customers in the space, aviation, alternative energy and defense industries. We have active direct DoD contracts as well as subcontracts for DoD programs. We currently employ about 20 personnel across engineering, operations, quality and business and administration departments and additionally the company has completed more than 10 million in government and commercial contracts and has raised about 5 million in funding to date.",
      "Answer 3": "As previously mentioned in the traction question, we're currently doing business with the government right now. We've secured our UEI number, we have cage code, we're registered within SAM and have been awarded numerous contracts through NASA, nsf, army and Air Force, among others, and we've also even registered with the ddtc."

They've received multiple SBIR's including a Phase 3 with the ARMY right now.  The tech is at TRL 9 with widespread use and they are currently generating just under a million each year with DoD.  The tech has allowed the teams using it to keep on track with their fitness and even gamify the experience.  They have an active ATO application in right now pending decision.  There's really nothing like this already in the cohort except for someone doing assessments with mental health, and having the two of them in the same room would likely make them both more valuable to the decision makers for this.  Recommending for invite.  ",
      "Answer 1": "Greetings. My name is Greg Hayward. I'm the founder and CEO of Trackable Health. We originally started as in home pharmacy. We have a smart medication dispenser solution that I was looking to get a better understanding of the state of being of our patients and caregivers and providers by leveraging off the shelf wearable custom cots, fitness devices from Whoop, Aura and Garmin and we have navigated the SBIR process and hold a phase three contract with the Air Force to be able to provide them multiples of dashboards so they can get an understanding of the state of readiness of personnel and be able to better manage workloads, job shifts and all the kind of particulars in creating job satisfaction, to elongate careers and to generally improve morale. We have gamified the platform and they have developed an incentivization program around that to be able to reward personnel for meeting the metrics and setting the standards that they expect. The Air Force doesn't command people to exercise, but they have an expectation of fitness and readiness and we're able to validate that. 3, 365, 247 to be able to challenge the physical fitness assessment that only happens twice a year and has a lot of friction and injury associated with it. So we are sport supported by Vantic, aws, Deloitte and others that are of the economy of scale so we can scale quickly.",
      "Answer 2": "Trackable Health has successfully navigated the SBIR process. We were awarded a Phase one contract initially around improving medication adherence standards by leveraging our smart medication dispenser. We won a second phase one from the Air Force around being able to build trust in AI applications. Then we were awarded a direct to Phase two by Eielson Air Force Base up in Alaska to put devices on personnel to create a Z score across devices. The AFRL had shared they had a high degree of confidence within devices but not across devices. We have a Phase three contract with Eielson now and we are about to enter into another with the 331st Recruiting Squadron. We're also working with the fire department at Eielson to be able to solve a regulatory challenge they have upcoming and being able to monitor people's sleep duration and sleep quality as well as their readiness. They're really the first to address the downstream impacts that could come from deploying somebody who maybe not be in an optimal state to be deployed. So event markers facilitate that and we are expanding out into commercial spaces such as Medtronic.",
      "Answer 3": "As a Phase three contract holder, we have met all of the requirements for cyber compliance and we have exceeded those in our data storage by configuring an AWS Gov cloud. So data comes from the wearable devices and goes to the manufacturer. Then we're alerted, there's an update and we pull the data down through webhooks, model it for the Z score impact and then be able. Then we store it in the govcloud environment. We're driving for an ATO at Eielson. We are in the midst of our CMMC audit as well and look to progress through FredRamp and deliver an on prem solution to meet the zero trust compliance that's eminent. So we are well positioned to be able to advance within the government."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "The venture uses Ai/ML to aggregate data from millions of documents, drawings, and mappings using LLM to put the data together for actionable outcomes.\n\nThey've made alot of traction across 15 SBIR's for these use cases and are working directly with commercial entities on marine applications as well.  They've generated 13 million in SBIR funding for their venture which signals a good amount of traction.\n\nWhat I found really interesting was where other companies we've found that are doing something similar have to redact certain info for TS clearances, they are using push notifications instead to be proactive about getting the relevant info out to the right end user with the right security clearance so they can use the data for their actionable agenda.\n\nThis can be used for UAV mapping, intelligence, marine mapping, structure locations, diagnostics, personnel, and much more.\n\nThey have a solid team of 15 mostly comprised of engineers and data scientists with a few people working on bizdev.  They are interested in this program because while SBIR's haven't been an issue for them, they are looking for more visibility with PEO's.\n\nRecommending for an invite.  ",
      "Answer 1": "Hi, I'm Jim Kukla, CTO and co founder at Redshred. I'm here to talk to you today about our platform, Redshred, which is a Documents as a Database solution. The problem that we're solving is being able to get data up and out of unstructured formats. Things like legacy PDFs, things like PowerPoints, Word documents, those types of things, and to bring that content up and out of those documents and make it available to build a really cool new generation of downstream applications. We're talking about things like virtual reality for training, for maintenance, augmented reality for things like flight line and actual operational maintenance, and to bring this into things like mobile applications, and even integrate with large language models as well. The way we do this is that we leverage a combination of technologies across the spectrum of AI and machine learning, including computer vision and natural language processing. And we bring all of this together to create layers of enriched metadata on these documents. Think about it as kind of a magic AI highlighter for all the kinds of things that you're interested in in these documents. For things like mechanical maintenance procedures, it might be notes, warnings and cautions and procedure steps and diagrams. And that information is now structured and available in an API first way so that developers can pull that information into their applications without first copying and pasting it out into their own databases. And this really accelerates the adoption of these new technologies. And our Documents as a database platform gives you the ability to search this semantically based on the physical geographical relationships of content, as well as the plain text content that you have there too. And so it really provides this way to get a continual rising tide of value that comes from working on these different documents and pulling content out for these applications.",
      "Answer 2": "So Traction Red Shred's been primarily bootstrapped through the SBIR program. We took a small amount of seed funding, a little bit less than 200k, I think, but we've actually won over 13 awards for the CBIR program so far. Actually, I think it's 15 awards totaling over $13 million, which is effectively amounted to seed funding to build out the product as well as demonstrate possible use cases around it. These things have had to do with integrating with artificial intelligence models as well as augmented reality and virtual real, working for things like flight line maintenance and other scenarios kind of in the DoD maintenance domain. The team is about 15 engineers and data scientists with a couple of administrative staff and our CEO. We've been awarded three patents for technologies and solutions related to our core platform. And we've got some commercial revenue as well. But we're really looking to sort of scale beyond the sort of phase two pipeline for the CIBBER program and get commercial revenue growing in 2025. We're also working on trying to get to our first real F phase 3s through the SBIR program. And that's one of the primary reasons that we're interested in working with you all, you know, is to really be able to dial in that value proposition and provide solutions to the warfighter that really move the needle for. For their mission needs.",
      "Answer 3": "How government ready is the venture? We certainly didn't start out that way. We started primarily as a commercial venture. But early on we got a phase two, a direct to phase two with the Air Force which started to lead us down this path of understanding what it meant to be ready to work with the government. We do have things like UEI numbers, cage codes. We as I mentioned before we've had several SBIR wins. We're actually in process right now for a facility security clearance and we do have we're a member of the Tradewinds ota so we're available through that vehicle and we have several sole source eligible SBIR contracts that we are working under as well. We're still working on getting to that first real phase three, but yeah, all the rest of those things I think are lined up and, and we're in pretty good shape to work with the government and, and excited about working with the war fighter."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/23/25 - Booked call for 1/24/25 @ 1600 EST\n\n1/25/25 -Met with Karl\u2014this was my best meeting so far. His team at Pulse Space is developing laser technology for space and air applications with multiple capabilities. Their high-powered lasers can remotely charge satellites on the dark side of the Earth, allowing them to operate at full capacity rather than relying on power reserves. Additionally, their lasers can send and receive data, which helps prevent data leakage as a side benefit.\n\nBeyond satellites, their technology has the potential to charge high-altitude drones and can be adjusted to charge an entire fleet simultaneously. They are currently at TRL 6-7 and believe they can reach TRL 8-9 in their next round. Few other companies are working on similar applications, making them a strong candidate for collaboration and further learning.\n\nPulse Space has gained commercial traction, already working with Starlab and other unnamed partners. They have received SBIR grants and are government-ready, possessing a UEI, CAGE Code, and Contract Vehicle. They are currently in discussions with all branches of the military except for the Marines, including official conversations with PACAF and ongoing discussions with Colonel John Morris and Craig Banner at Indopacom. While they are engaging in \u201cunofficial\u201d conversations with private entities, their primary challenge is obtaining higher TS clearance to secure additional contracts. They have a mission in October that, once completed, will improve their clearance level.\n\nThe company currently has nine team members, primarily engineers, and plans to grow to 25 by the end of the year. Their traction began in September when they won Techstars, and they are also collaborating with a partner company to enable 15-minute drop shipping to almost anywhere in the world.\n\nGiven their unique technology, government readiness, and growth trajectory, Pulse Space would be a valuable contractor and an asset for SigmaBlox.

      "Answer 1": "So Pulse Space is building a remote power grid in orbit using high energy lasers and tuned receivers to deliver much more watts per kilowatt than a solar cell can aggregate. And what makes it special is that we can provide power 24 7, 365 days a year, whereas most satellites, in fact, all satellites in LEO orbit right now spend about a third of their time in Earth's shadow, which means they're not operating at full power, which is a loss of a lot of revenue. And we solve this problem by using high energy lasers. We gather solar power from the sun and we transmit it to receivers that are hosted on satellites in LEO. And that allows them to be powered up dramatically 24 hours a day.",
      "Answer 2": "So we've got a lot of traction. Our team is now up to eight people. We are building our hardware for our first demo mission that's coming in October. We've signed our first commercial contract with Star Lab, a multinational space station. We have a lot of DoD interest. We're talking to every branch of the military besides the Marines, pursuing multiple contracts. We have multiple IP filed. And, yeah, we're in the middle of raising $5 million. Had a few hundred thousand coming into the bank so far, and I'm looking to close that now.",
      "Answer 3": "So we're getting close to being government ready. We're in negotiations for multiple contracts right now. We have our UEI number, we have our cage code, we don't have a contract vehicle yet and we're pursuing our DD254. There is four different routes to get that. There are multiple contract talks that are going on, some that are low seven figures and some are unknown amount so far, but we're ready. We just need to finish getting the contract vehicle and then work on getting our clearance."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "Booked 3/6/25 @ 1500 EST\n\nThe Fraclex group is a venture creating cyber security solutions specifically with the warfighter in mind.  They're commerical/dual use case is designed specifically to further their main product for the warfighter.  Their intent is to link cyber security offense and defense at the tactical, operational, and enterprise level so DoD doesn't need to segment their cyber security solutions and have communications get lost from department to department.  Using quantum encryption/decryption, their tech creates simulated war games for every scenario the requires cyber offense or defense.  They spoke highly of the gov connections they've made already and the insights/forecasts that have been made on what's needed for these cyber solutions so they can develop their tech to feed just that.  As a cyber company, they are opting to not file patents and circumnavigate fed ramp as long as they can to keep their tech away from any breach.  Their dual use case offers similar solutions for NFL, Oil & Gas, as well as energy.  They've secured contracts with primes to subcontract work from them in amounts up to $12 mil over 3 years..  Their prototyping for their wargame solutions which are to move into real time ready once tested have been assessed and validated at a TRL 6.  They have basic gov readiness and are acquiring their ATO.  Several members on the team have TS security clearance  they are taking very cautious measures to keep their IP off of any server that is at risk for a breach.  Given what they are doing and several members of our cohort that have already been accepted for quantum computing, I can see them adding to the mix of collaboration as much of what they are doing relies on quantum.  Recommending for invite.",
      "Answer 1": "Hi, my name is Amanda Henninger and I'm the CEO and co founder of the Fraclix Group llc. Our problem that we have identified through extensive requirements interviewing predating the establishment of our company in March of 2024, originally with a lot of the code commands including into paycom to discuss various flashpoints that we were going to see in terms of security and insecurity for cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, drone technologies and communications in terms of in theater and also in training environments. As a result, my company, which includes a team of experts that range from everything from astrophysics to quantum cryptography to counterintelligence to special operations, we are able to package solutions that not only address the cybersecurity elements in terms of offensive, defensive and decoy technologies, but also generative AI as well as SOL language modeling integrations so that we can create not only capability packages that deal with a lot of the cyber training and communications issues at the enterprise level, but also through partnerships with IOTAI and other companies, develop the first novel architecture of its kind that'll represent a 10x systems architecture and system orchestration. And what I mean by this is we're going to link the tactical edge to the enterprise. You'll be able essentially to have a ready player 1 type wargaming and training environment on steroids. That's our first stage in terms of how we plan to iterate and develop a lot of our rapid prototyping solutions that address everything from countering EW effects to response in a disaster zone. We have the subject matter expertise to not only deliver the technological capabilities, but additionally write the curriculum. Everyone on our senior team has lived at the tip of the sphere or served at the tip of the sphere in some capacity. So we have a very, very nuanced understanding not only of the technological elements, of what need to be included and how we scale to things like true quantum, but also how do we account for the nuance in the field and make sure that our operators and our.",
      "Answer 2": "We are currently pre revenue as we just registered in March 2024. We have taken a more of a cautious approach as we have been working on our product development which we have thus far bootstrapped between myself and my co founder close to $200,000 of ourselves on our own and as a result we have been able to create a lot of the prototyping while keeping it completely secure and off the grid. We are in discussions with three different angel investors for potential early stage investment. We are also in discussions with three large primes for mental protege agreements and are waiting on introductions to Palantir and Anduril in terms of contract negotiations. We are currently in open discussions with the U.S. air Force, space Force, Space Development Agency, National Guard as well as socom. We have already won two awards by being invited to attend as subject matter experts at SOCOM foundries 14 and 15 as well as being invited for the Rapid Capability Assessment in Scotland in the fall of last year. We currently are negotiating a relicensing of an exclusive patent with the Department of Energy which supports our cybersecurity portfolio as well.",
      "Answer 3": "So we are currently in the process of setting up ATO and Fedramp in a box via Ask Sage which would also help with facility clearance once we have certain contracts negotiated. We will also additionally be able to house some of my staff that I will be bringing on that have TS or higher clearance and I've also worked with the DOD or IC in the past or Special Operations itself. We do have a CAGE code. We do have a UEI. We are in the process of getting approved for 8A set aside status as a women owned business. As A I own 90% of my company in addition to all other contracting compliance requirements. We are fully ready and able to be onboarded for any type of government contracting as required. We would if we make it through the challenge we would be interested in discussing any kind of sponsorship if there are specific projects that that is an option for. But other than that everything else should be aligned according to what we need to be able to compete in this challenge. So thank you for your time."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "The venture's claim to being in the advanced sciences is accurate, but it's nuanced.  With great traction and a dual use case, they've developed a software to forecast fatigue, corrosion, and efficiency of parts being used in space and air.  Too often through manufacturing or overlooking this expensive process to forecast, we're using ineffective parts in absolutely critical missions that are failing.  While the company started out as a service to this process, they realized their speed was hindered by not productizing it.  So, they' brought on PhD technologists to develop a software to do the forecasting for the parts and materials used by DoD.  Now, their current clients outside the DoD include Lockheed, RTX, and Sikorsky.  All of which have adopted their patented tech.  They've received $20M in SBIR funding including a phase 3 and continue to generate 3-5 million per year in commercial use cases.  They have UEI, Cage Code, Contract vehicle, have worked out of of classified facilities, and several members of their team have TS clearance.  Recommending for invite. ",
      "Answer 1": "Study at Science is a US based small business that specializes in advanced digital engineering solutions that focus on fatigue life of metals. This expertise has enabled us to develop a unique portfolio of solutions that directly contribute to the accelerated adoption of additive manufacturing for aerospace parts to include safety or flight critical parts. We market this capability under the brand name Digital Clone. To recognize what's special about DigitalCloam, we start with one simple concept. Components break when their materials fail. If you're interested in how, when and why this will happen, you must understand the material at the microstructure level and this is where most solutions are lacking. Digital Clone is the only cloud based software that can show the relationship between A and print processes, material microstructure and fatigue life performance and this enables users to anticipate how long a part will last and its intended application based on AM machine settings and the material being used. This offers significant cost and time savings versus the traditional approach of build, test, break. Digital Clone for In Situ Monitoring or DCIM is an advanced cyber physical solution that integrates our powerful digital engineering capabilities into an AM machine environment to enable layer by layer monitoring of the additive manufacturing process. The product of multiple SBIR Phase 2 programs with the U.S. army and U.S. air Force, DCIM has successfully demonstrated the ability to autonomously detect and correct process defects that would impact fatigue life performance of metal AM parts. Initial results from our army program show a 25% improvement in quality and a 60% increase in fatigue life versus standard AM processes. The solution currently in development with AF Works will be capable of deployment in military shipping containers for printing at point of need of key capability for operating in a contested logistics environment.",
      "Answer 2": "So our company is quite small with 15 full time employees right now which include seven PhD scientists. We're not big, but we have a strong history of successfully competing in the Small Business Innovation Research or CPR program with over $20 million in phase one and phase two awards and we were awarded a CPR phase three IDIQ contract with the US army in 2023. That's valued at $9 million over five years. Last year's revenue was a little more than $3 million, about half of which came from government contracts. We do have seven patents for our fatigue performance modeling technologies. Our awards include the Tibbets Award For Cibber Excellence, four first place awards in the 2022 NIST Additive Manufacturing Benchmark Challenge and and we were finalists for the 2024 Defense TechConnect Innovation Challenge. In 2023, Sikorsky published a white paper for the Vertical Flight Society that called our digital clone fatigue life prediction capability vital for the design and analysis of a gearbox system. So we're quite pleased with that and our strongest collaborative relationships in the aerospace market include companies like Lockheed Martin, RTX, Bell Flight and RollsRoyce.",
      "Answer 3": "So as far as how government ready we are, we've been doing business with the US government for over 15 years to include contracts with NASA, Department of Energy, NSF and the Army, Navy and Air Force research organizations. We're established in SAM with UEI and CAGE codes and our team has executed both firm fixed price and cost plus contracts with the DoD. We're in the second year of performance right now for our CBIR Phase 3 IDIQ contract with the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Aviation and Missile Center CCDC ADMIC which features a number of task orders being executed as cost plus fixed fee. We're also currently executing multiple Sibir phase two projects with the US army and Air Force. Given the outlook for 2025 we do expect to add three to five employees within the next six months. We have self certified our compliance with NIST 800171 and we're working towards CMMC compliance. We don't have any contracts right now that require security clearances, although we do have one employee with a secret clearance. We do not have IT systems or facilities cleared for classified work at this time."

They opened just in 2023 with a pre seed round of 1.3 million in funding, and have secured over 41 million dollars in contracts since then mostly on the commercial side.  Right now, they've build a model with 6ft wingspan and another with a 13 foot wing span that carries up to 100lbs payload capacity and has capabilities of flying over 100 miles without being detected.  Their commercial use case is mainly on the logistics side with Greece and South America.  The company is also focussed on DoD with other capabilities in the drones they are building such a several week long loitering capability on water to be used with ammunitions if needed and counter UAS capabilities.  They have a UEI, CAGE Code, and several of the team have TS clearance.  They are also another recommendation from Cat Orman who has been stellar ini finding us great ventures.  Recommending for an invite.  ",
      "Answer 1": "Howdy. My name is David. Our startup is posed in aerospace. We're working on unmanned seaplane systems that are ground effect vehicles. These are unmanned systems that exist for local and coastal operations which at the small scale. Our first product is 13 foot seapline and this has applications in both ISR logistics, advanced exploratory Base Operations and Anti submarine warfare. Basically we have one of the only systems that is cross domain in terms of it can land and take off on water, operate under radar and deliver goods without much infrastructure, if any at all. Currently we have a contract with the Naval Surface Warfare center and works and we'll be demonstrating with Coastal Trident and Antics as well as Jifix. And in general we're working towards a larger 50 foot scale seaplane that will be capable of carrying 2 tons. How do we solve it? We build planes and ground up so fully integrated design, manufacturing operations.",
      "Answer 2": "Okay. Currently we have raised pre seed funding. About a year ago we made initial hires. We have built and designed a six foot prototype vehicle and are completing a 13 foot wingspan vehicle. Right now we are in the process of finalizing a CRADA with the Naval Surface Warfare Center. We are demonstrating to Multiple Navy and DoD customers participating in antics. Coastal Trident will likely be participating in JIFIX as well. On the commercial side, we have signed a contract in one $40 million LOI and another actual contract for the 13 foot vehicle with a total contract value of I believe like 1.7 million.",
      "Answer 3": "Yes, we are government ready as far as UA number, CAGE code, DUNS number all the things we've applied for government contracts or in the systems. One of our co founders has top secret security clearance. But yeah, I think all the preliminary boxes to check to participate and interact with DoD and government entities are there."

We make training and simulation software for the Department of the Air Force and also supporting other federal agencies. Our focus is on building synthetic training environments, virtual realities and other immersive experiences. Leveraging our deep expertise in video game development to build engaging and fun experiences for training. One good example of our technology is our site selection and visitation system. This is a product currently in Cibir Phase 2 with the Air Force, with our partner at the 147th Attack Wing. It's a technology that uses machine vision to identify expedient and contingency airfields all across the Pacific. But then we use our gaming background and generative AI to, to build immersive 3D models of those landing sites so that the site teams, the inspection teams, can actually conduct virtual and remote visits of these simulated synthetic environments. The impact of the Air Force is that they're able to go in and find places they otherwise couldn't find a land things like highways and roads and parking lots and honestly fields and find a way to get their aircraft down to support potential conflict with China.",

Paired with complex compliance demands and not enough people. Our complete approach unites cybersecurity training, compliance frameworks and and hands on workforce development. But more importantly, the deployment to help keep our country strong and resilient, ready for whatever comes next today. For me, protecting our nation's cyber backbone isn't just good business. It's a patriotic responsibility. Whether you're a local government, critical infrastructure growing business, we will stand by with and through our partners to build a solid defense. In short, Lionfish Cybersecurity ensures that our country and allies can and will survive. When there is no calvary coming to protect us, we will raise an army of cyber warriors from the universities. We will organize, train, equip them and immediately start deploying cyber resiliency and compliance mechanisms to our critical infrastructures, local governments and small businesses in their area of influence. We do not have time to debate our cyber failings as a country. The enemy is in the wire today and we are the only solution on the table that can solve this problem at scale. We need to fast track decision makers. We do not have time to wait six months. We need to get started now and realize a vision of a resilient America and our allies around the globe. The number one truth in special operations community is people are more important than hardware and we can organize, train, equip and deploy the people we need around the globe. Lionfish is a global cybersecurity workforce multiplier. Thank you.",
      "Answer 2": "Hi. So I'm going to go quick. A minute and a half is not long for what I have. So we have a patent pending that we're disputing with the PTO office right now. This, this last year, 2024 was a stellar thought leadership year for us. We've published four IEEE papers in AI and cybersecurity. We realized one of them already which was customized cyber awareness training for the vertical of the industry. The company specific, the data, the departments and day to day operations. So we can do that. We also took that a step further and we are the first ones to build cyber awareness. Music training Very, very awesome. Catchy. Memorable. Better than sitting there watching a boring video. We were nominated for four Tech Point awards, State of Indiana. It's a very big deal for that. We were also I was also nominated actually by Purdue for Tech Exec of the Year with our IBJ Indianapolis Business Journal. We are a accredited training provider with a with the Cyber AB for cmmc.

      "Answer 3": "So from the government side we are in sams. We've got our UEI number, we got our cage codes. We are, we are ready for bidding there. I don't have my security clearance. I used to have one. It fell off. I wasn't using it. So I had, I did have an TSSCI at one time. We can get those again. As you know we do have a few stumbling blocks that we need to discuss. One is cmmc. As you know we are a training provider for that. Our platform is also being used to help elevate the subs to the CMMC level 2 right now however, what has happened with the government is they've said that all of the software that's used to help the contractors subcontractors get their CMMC have to be Fedramp qualified now. So Fedramp qualification and certification is very, very expensive. We have looked into this but we need some help in getting there financially which is a big, big step. But from that point forward I think you'll see we're very everything else, we're government ready. But that is an issue that we have is going forward. Thank you."

These are the type of drones that you see on Twitter causing all the chaos in Ukraine. They are currently responsible for 85% of all battlefield casualties in Ukraine and they've really revolutionized the tactical battlefield in the modern warfare. We believe in order to counter the FPV threat and the small UAS threat that traditional air defense doctrine of protecting certain assets or having only certain units provide the air defense is obsolete. We believe that you must protect everyone, everything, everywhere, all the time. Or as we call it E3 3 at 2 in order to accomplish this we build intelligent autonomous first easy to use software and we pair that with our own custom designed purpose built hardware and then lastly custom engineered munitions that we've built specifically for the counter UAS and counter FPV threat.",

      "Answer 3": "Yeah. So I'm an Army Reserve officer. I'm a captain stationed at Fort Bragg. So I maintained a tssci, as well as one of our other employees. The company itself doesn't yet have a security clearance. We do have a UEI. We do have a cage code. We are on SAM.gov registered. We are working currently on a contract vehicle. We are going down multiple avenues with a couple different major commands and other groups to move it towards that so that people can have that vehicle to purchase it. Lastly, we're working to finalize a partnership with one of the world's largest firearms and ammunition manufacturers, who is going to help us provide scale and international distribution in our manufacturing of our systems, which will help us, when we're speaking with government contracting officers, provide them with a level of comfort that we can deliver on the contracts that they ask of us."

They're working on blue teaming and red teaming across all infrastructures and attack hardware as well.  Commercially, they're generating just under a million in vertical industries like casino gaming and fin tech to fund more defense tech ventures.  Privately, they're a sub for Imperial Cyber and other Primes for NSA work.  All of their proprietary tech is at TRL 9, and they have a large support team to iterate for any customization needed.  They have basic gov readiness levels with UEI, CAGE Code, high TRL.  This feels like a tech ready with advanced cyber security tech that needs a little extra push with gov ready levels in an incubator like ours.  Strongly recommending for invite.  The CEO and their lead engineer both joined on the call and would make a addition for SigmaBlox.  Spoke well, direct, and truthful throughout the entire call.",
      "Answer 1": "The opportunity that we have here is pretty nice. So businesses big and small, they struggle with costly, complex security solutions that lack consolidated and actionable intelligence. They install multiple security tools that require costly developer integration and create a really fractured view of their security posture. So the way that we solve that is we positioned ourselves along Pantera and Crowdstrike with our load testing. Automated pen testing and remediation are in a single pane window and with a unique offer of non invasive honeypots for more actionable network threat intelligence. We have trusted partnerships from the United nations and we're a reliable partner for sectors prioritizing security, privacy, and actionable defense. We keep everything in one place so you can see all of your problems, and we have partnerships for remediation on top of that.",
      "Answer 2": "So some of the traction that we've gotten is we have a signed letter of intent from the Ukrainian government for our technology, basically from their version of the Department of Homeland Security and the Ministry of Defense. We have a working product, enterprise ready product. We're in our first year. We've been profitable for six months in our first year of operation. We also have had a demo at the Pentagon in the past couple months, and we are set to have another demo with them this month for another paid poc. We engaged with high profile clients such as Movado, the watch company, and obviously the dod. We also have been working with other primary contractors to be subcontractors for contracts in the Navy. Just as well.",
      "Answer 3": "We do have our SAM code and cage codes as well, you know. We have all of our Nikes codes figured out. They're on our website. You can check those out. The way that we've been approaching working with the government contracts has been through subcontracting and sometimes sub. Subcontracting through different companies like Imperial Cyber, XCOM and. And Digital Radiance. DG Radiance, sorry. These people have contracts with khaki and things like that in the Navy and in the nsa. And we work on small parts of the contracts that they, that they have brought up. That's something that we just broke into this year. And through that subcontracting, they push down their TS facility clearance on top of us as a result. But we are actively working to get our own TS facility clearance as well as a company."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "Booked call for 2/18/25 @ 1030 EST\n\n2/18/25 - The venture created a simple solution to a complex problem with a great dual use case.  They've developed a cloud based bluetooth low energy sensor to be used on containers in commercial flights and military flights.  On the commercial side, every plane flies with containers that carry their life rafts and emergency plane supplies across multiple containers in the aircraft and every flight requires inspection of these containers which takes a lot of time.  The sensors they've developed cuts all of this manual process away.  It works in GPS and WiFi jammed locations and keeps the data until arrival.  It can be monitored in real time from an onsite device as well or uploaded once at destination.  For military, they are using the same technology for containers that contain classified or sensitive information in flight, land travel, sea travel, or drones carrying cargo.  They go through a similar process for inspecting containers that is still manual, and this solution mitigates time and guess work.  The company's tech is at TRL 6.  They're FAA compliant for the commercial side.  They've been awarded $1.5M in SBIR funding.  The tech is patented, and they're moving fast towards widespread use.  They have UEI, CAGE Code, Contract Vehicle, and are pending ATO.  Recommending for invite. ",
      "Answer 1": "In both commercial aviation and military logistics, managing the security, tracking and readiness of critical assets is a challenge. Traditional methods such as manual inspections, physical seals and all tracking systems can be time consuming, error prone and inefficient. At aerosense, we develop a cloud based platform able to maximize security and increase efficiency. Using Bluetooth, low energy sensors and everyday smartphone or tablet, we are able to automate safety and security inspections, digital sealing and we are able to send real time alerts if something has been tampered with. With our solution, different teams can communicate, report and perform inspections in seconds. We provide feasibility.",
      "Answer 2": "We founded Airosense back in 2018, and at that time our goal it was to help airlines to be more efficient in their operations, develop technology solutions for them to be more efficient in their operations. So by the end of 2019, we had our first MVP. We did a POC at Airbus headquarters in France. And then 2020 happens. I think that the only good thing about that year is that we got our first patents granted. And then our goal was to maintain the team. Our industry was on the ground, so our target was to keep the team, continue developing the solution. In 2021, we approached Afwork, so we got a contract for a phase one, and then in 2023 we got the phase two. But also those years we kept working with the airlines, showing them, doing ground demos for them. And in 2023 we were selected by Boeing to be part of the accelerator program and we became a Boeing Portio company. We did our first flight test with British Airways and we kept working with fworks. Currently we are still fundraising because we want to apply. Our target with the military is to apply for a TACFI grant.",
      "Answer 3": "We just completed an AF works phase two. In fact, part of the scope of the TACFI grant is to get the ATO readiness Readiness. And I think that our solution aligns perfectly with the DoD needs us Transcom and to monitor the security of containers to provide in transit visibility. Yeah, I think working with Sigma Fox Sigma blocks will be a great opportunity for us to expand in our solution in the military."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "Booked call 3/7/25 @ 1300 EST\n\nSwarmbotics developed 2 autonomous ground vehicle products that can work in swarm and are currently at TRL 6.  The company received $19M in funding to start their venture within the past 2 years, and they've developed both of their models at an ultra low cost for use specifically in the DoD.  One model is about the size of an RV car with a 75lb payload capactiy and the other is about the size of an RV with a 350 payload capacity.  One of the problems they solve is that unmanned ground vehicles are typically very expensive which is a problem because many of them never come back from their missions while Swarmbotics created two very low cost modules.  They've developed software so they can operate in swarms with many use cases such as, terrain shaping, mine finding, modular mobile UAV charging bases, recon, and self destruction if needed.  With 25 employees, they've made traction with SBIR's, several CRETA programs, cash positive rev, and other various gov adoption programs from SOCOM and others that have led to an incredible amount of feedback.  Several members of the team have TS clearance individually, and their CEO previously led Pratt Miller to over $250 million in gov contracts before starting Swarmbotics.  Strongly recommending for an invite. ",
      "Answer 1": "Good morning, I'm Steve Potter. I'm head of growth at Swarmbotics. At Swarmbotics, we're solving a major challenge in defense and security. Specifically how to deploy autonomous robotic systems that are both affordable and adaptable in contested environments. Right now, military robotics tend to focus on high cost, high complexity systems like the robotic combat vehicle. The challenge is these systems are expensive, fragile and cannot scale effectively. The military needs a more flexible, cost effective solution. Something that can operate in the real world without requiring pristine conditions or extensive infrastructure. That's where Swarmbotics comes in. We specialize in attritable autonomous systems. Robotic platforms designed to be low cost, modular and operationally effective in denied or degraded environments. Our Fire Ant and Hall Ant platforms use collaborative autonomy, meaning they can work together in swarms to conduct logistics, reconnaissance and force protection missions, even when GPS and communications are jammed. We achieve this through AntsNet AI, which enables decentralized decision making and adaptability in real time. Ultimately, we provide a risk hedge for defense customers, allowing them to rapidly deploy autonomy without betting everything on expensive, exquisite platforms. Leveraging commercial grade hardware, open architectures and swarm intelligence, we're bringing the future of autonomous warfare to the present with scalable, affordable and ready to deploy systems. We're excited about the potential of our technology not just in defense, but in public safety and industrial security. Swarm Botics is redefining what is possible with autonomous ground systems, and we're looking forward to scaling our impact through this accelerator.",
      "Answer 2": "Swarmbotics has made tremendous progress in a short time, proving both technical viability and market demand for our autonomous systems. We've grown to a team of 25 employees with deep expertise in robotics, AI and defense integration. Financially, we've raised two sequential funding rounds including a $4 million pre seed round and a 15 million dollar seed round to fuel our growth in product development. On the revenue side, in 2024 we secured $175,000 through a Phase 1 CBIR with Special Operations Command, and we anticipate the 2025 order intake to be between 4 million and 5 million in new contract awards. We've also been selected for nine DoD experiments, including Project Convergence, both Alpha and Bravo Venue, Navy Silence, Warm, SOCOM Collaborative Autonomy, as well as Dragon Spear Sustainment Modernization Exercise and Maneuver Fires Integration Exercise, among others. We believe this validates our technology in real world operational scenarios. These experiments give us direct exposure to end users and decision makers, accelerating adoption within the US Military. We've also established or are in process of establishing three cradas with the United States Army Special Operations, United States Navy and United States Army.",
      "Answer 3": "Swornbottix is fully registered to do business with the United States government. We are fully registered in sam. We have a UEI CAGE code. This allowed us to contract directly with federal agencies like we did in our Phase one sbir with socom. We're actively pursuing follow on awards. While we don't have a facility clearance at this point, we anticipate that a future program through a CRADA or program sponsorship could occur in 2025. In the meantime, we're structuring our business and operations to be security ready, ensuring that when the opportunity arises, we can seamlessly transition to working in classified environments. Beyond compliance. Our government engagement has been extensive. We're currently participating in DoD experiments giving us direct feedback from military operators and acquisition professionals. We also have three in process cradles with Special Operations, the Army and the Navy. We believe those will provide us collaborative pathways for developing and partnering with the government on technology development. We believe our growing track record of government partnerships will allow us to expand our footprint within the DOD. Sworn biotics will be government ready fully in 2025. We're actively shaping the future of autonomous ground systems. This accelerator would help within that process for paycom."

      "Video Notes": "Materials company that extends the length and increases the accuracy of munition barrels.  Good gov readiness.  Extending a call invite to learn more. ",
      "Phone Interview Notes": "The venture, 300 Below, is a company that's developed a technology to increase the life and accuracy of gun barrels for any application.  These could be barrels for ships, tanks, possibly drones as we continue to develop or anything else that fires.  They've patented this technology and over time have that it increases the life of the barrel by 3x and even increases the accuracy as well as decreasing downtime for reload or cooling when firing.  All for the cost of just about $10 $20 per barrel which poses significant cost reduction in any barrel that need to be bought again.  On the commercial side, they've generated millions each year for the past decade and they have a 17,000 sq ft facility if needed.  But, their tech in treating the barrels that are put in place is what the owner is interested in the DoD adopting.  As a veteran, he wants to see this tech in the hands of our warfighters, and he's interested in getting it into their hands any way possible.  I believe his patented tech could be useful to our program and the warfighter, and he would collaborate well with several of the munition ventures that have already committed to the program.  They have had multiple SBIR's, have UEI, CAGE Code, and a contract vehicle, and the tech is at TRL 9 with widespread adoption in commercial.  Recommending for invite.  ",
      "Answer 1": "300 below is involved with technology to increase warfighter lethality. We do this by two different primary applications. One is extending barrel life by 200% which increases the accuracy of the gun barrel significantly for the warfighter. It's been proven totally funded by a SBIR. Both SBIRs. Two SBIRs were successful doubling the life of gun barrels. The second item is in increasing war fighter lethality by increasing the accuracy of bullets. Bullets when cryogenically processed by a 300 blow technical process, increase their accuracy by 23 to 24% in two different tests. The TRL on that is approximately 4 still needs additional testing to prove viability and repeatability, but we believe that that will happen and the the other process of treating gun barrels has been proven and is completed. In addition to this, we can increase significantly the wear time for a number of applications from electric motors, transformers, gearboxes, transmissions, engines for a warfighter. So very significant benefits for a warfighter from the application cost effective scalable General cost is 10% for 200% additional life. So a very significantly compelling value proposition and scalable can go into the millions of pounds. We currently treat over a million pounds per year.",
      "Answer 2": "Traction. Traction for 300 below. 300 below is located in Decatur, Illinois. We won the Midwest technology of the year award in Chicago a couple years back. A very significant award for us. We've been in business since 1966. I married the technology to a computer about 30 years ago. We've since developed that and have some additional technologies that need development. We're a viable company. We've had 30 profitable years and maintain traction in a number of industries. Things from 3000 miles of guitar strings processed, over a million gun barrels processed to increase accuracy and longevity and tooling a myriad of different applications in the marketplace. We have an existing 17,000 square foot facility in Decatur, Illinois and that facility is fully employed, structured. We have zero debt. Value proposition again is it would be kind of like me asking you if you've got $20 in your pocket. Give me that $20. I'll exchange that for $200 in value for you. You'd say, how many times can we do that? I'd say, you can do that the rest of your life. 300 below has significant value proposition in the marketplace. Our challenge is penetration in the markets. Gun barrel manufacturers don't necessarily like us because we double the life of gun barrels. So we're seeking.",
      "Answer 3": "300 below is government ready. We have an existing cage code. Security clearances are possible. One of our president, past president of our company, my son Prescott, has maintains a ts. And we have a number of different applications that are sensitive. We process a number of optics for space, optical benches, platforms, bodies, things like that that are used in reconnaissance satellites, things like that. Government is readily available for us. We are viable and functional today. Have been for a number of years. Have been recognized in and reported on both of our sbirs successfully."

Their software-based approach requires no new hardware, making it highly adaptable.\n\nTheir main challenge is scaling beyond pilot projects and securing broader adoption. They have dual-use applications, including commercial partnerships with Honda and Meta, and have raised $3.5M in a seed round with $2M in contracts.\n\nCurrently field testing, including in Ukraine and Taiwan, they aim for real-time jamming detection. Their tech is commercially ready but still requires refinement for full government deployment.\n\nI would recommend they go through.",
      "Answer 1": "Hi, we're Zephyr XYZ and we're creating technology to map out gnss, interference, jamming, and spoofing on the battlefield. We do this by networking GPS receivers together and using measurements across that network of receivers to localize where jammers and spoofers are, and then also map out the areas that they're impeding with interference or spoofing attacks. In addition to this, the core technology that provides these kind of EW mapping capabilities also improves the accuracy and resiliency of the positioning across these devices. Currently, we're doing this primarily in a test bed with TAC devices through afrl.",
      "Answer 2": "Zephyr has been making wonderful traction both on the defense and commercial sides of the business. We currently are executing on an AFRL Phase 2 SBIR where we're integrating our EW mapping and localization capabilities into attack devices, and through that we're testing in Ukraine, we're setting up tests in Taiwan, and we've also collected spoofing data in Israel. We're also going to be testing at Apex, where we've been invited to test that in a live military exercise across that. In addition to the defense work on the commercial side, we're also working on a partnership with AWS to make our location SDK available to AWS developers. We've also set up a test bed with Hexagon and Ericsson, where we're taking Hexagons corrections and providing them across Ericsson's 5G network to be able to correct a wide variety of OEM handsets, IoT devices and automotive. And the great thing about that is from a defense standpoint, we'll be able to tap into any 5G connected device through those implemented protocols. We've also won a TGI AWS Generative AI grant to apply our location technology to training LLMs. Be spatially aware, we have contracts with an AR social company, Rideshare company, and we've also been done pilots with Samsung and Honda as well. Across the board, we have four patents and nine employees and have had $4.2 million in funding raised so far.",
      "Answer 3": "We believe our Zephyr is very well positioned for government work. We have our UEI CAGE codes we have an active contract with AFRL as a phase direct to Phase two SBIR I have a clearance that's on the shelf but could be reactivated to engage with customers within a classified setting and we're actively engaging across a number of programs working with different government partners As I mentioned in the last video with the APEX military exercise we also went through the Insin Propel program with PACAF where we made lots of wonderful connections we're able to demonstrate the technology but overall we believe the company is very well situated for continuing to execute and grow within the government space. In addition the the core team this is our fourth startup the first two went through the In Q Tel program in which we had four pilot customers within that we went through the full program all the way to ELA before the company was acquired so also very familiar with running through the program of getting up to ELAs with government agencies thank you.",

Recommending for an invite as they would diversify the group we have and be able to collaborate with other ventures well at SigmaBlox.",
      "Answer 1": "Hello, my name is Kamel Green, founder and CEO of Fiber X. In short, what Fiber X does is we eliminate faults on mission critical infrastructure. How we do that is we utilize fiber optics as a sensor based technology to monitor, to serve as a structural health monitoring platform as well as a corrosion detection ecosystem. The main problem is when it comes to critical infrastructure, that being the different capacities that we work in, aerospace, defense, application, offshore turbines, marine time, nuclear rods and all those different realms, any type of critical infrastructure, semiconductors, etc. The problem is, is that corrosion is a huge problem. Just within the Department of defense, they're spending $40 billion, I'm sorry, $40 million annually when it comes to just corrosion mitigation. And that's just dod, that's not doe, that's not the private sector. So corrosion is a massive problem. And so what we're able to do is we're able to use fiber optics as a sensor based technology where we hypoxi that to the critical infrastructure. Now it can happen prior to the, it can happen during the manufacturing process or after the manufacturing process. And as we hypoxi the sensor based technology to that critical infrastructure, we're able to then monitor the strain phenomenon. So monitor we have serve as a benchmark of the infrastructure. And then anytime there's a strain phenomenon, we're able to actually understand what's going on. So that data gets sent to a data dashboard or we have digital twin as well as data visualization. And so an administrator for space application, for satellites, for offshore turbines, for commercial airplanes, they're able in real time with this non invasive technology, understand the problems that are happening when it comes to structural, you know, fatigue or structural problems as well as corrosion. And this is unique because we're solving that problem. Typically it's visual inspection, typically it's sonar. However, the difference is this solution is non invasive. You're able to be preemptive opposed to reactive. Thank you.",
      "Answer 2": "Hello. We're excited to note that we actively have a license with the US Navy, which is a patent. And so we have exclusive rights within 15 different fields of use, that being defense semiconductors, nuclear rods, multiple different applications centered around every area of focus that we're in, which provides us defensibility. So we know that no one can provide the solution that we're providing and the application in which we do it in. But in addition to that, it provides credibility. We're able to not only glean from partnerships because we are directly working with the US Navy, which is in the Department of Defense and able to navigate off of that. In addition to that, we currently have a pending Space act agreement with NASA. And so we're excited to potentially get that rolling, as well as a pending CRADA with Harrisburg University out in Pennsylvania. In addition to that, as far as awards, we did complete the Starburst aerospace accelerator. From a venture standpoint, we raised $200,000 from a venture capital firm. We currently have $400,000 soft circled. We're raising $1 million round. So we're just over 50% excited to close up that raise within the next month or so. And so where we are right now, as far as our employee count, we have about six employees, and we're really excited to go to market. We're excited to note that we currently have two active pilots, one sub defense contractor, as well as a corrosion consulting firm out of Louisiana. Thank you.",
      "Answer 3": "We believe that we're government ready. Now, not only are we actively working with the government currently, as we currently have a license with the US Navy, but also we have our cage number, we have our samhs.gov when it comes to clearances, we're in the process of reactivating that. Not only do I come from a national security background and where I've worked within national security, and so I have attained a security clearance once before and so we're currently getting that back up to date. But in addition to that, our company is actively going after super contracts. We're aware, you know, of the different contracts that are available. We've already put in multiple different applications quite recently. But in addition to that, we're working with NASA too. And so as I mentioned the previous question, we have a pending Space act agreement with NASA. And so not only are we government ready, we're actively working with the government. But there's a lot to learn and that's why we're excited to potentially work with you all. And we feel like this is not just me, but it's our team as well. Our team has tremendous knowledge when it comes to working with the government. I'm a two time founder who's worked with the government before. So when it comes to procurements, requests for proposals, those are all the intricacies that sometimes make it difficult, especially when working with the bureaucratic government. But we have a strategy and that's why we're currently closing with those partnerships to be able to actively speed up the process and navigate the government. Thank you."

      "Video Notes": "Need to learn more about what the venture actually does at the end of the day, but it sounds like they are gathering and streamlining flightline coordination and maintenance data to make sure no matter the personnel, they have the info they need to do the job for all things air craft related.  Good gov readiness and phase 3 sbir.  Team of 9 full time. ",
      "Phone Interview Notes": "Booked call for 2/18/15 @ 1130 EST\n\nThe venture has built tech to streamline flightline crews that are working on maintenance and repair of aviation and drones.  Basically, their platform logs all work and troubleshooting in real time then stores that data for future use.  So, the tech is only getting better as it's being used.  Their software eliminates lengthy times for repairs and maintenance as well as the loss of experienced technicians.  All jobs can be viewed in real time and the data of how troublesome repairs is stored so it can be used widespread.  They've got good commercial traction with airlines and on the defense side, they have multiples SBIR;s totaling awards of about 2.1 million.  They are working with AFRL for adoption, and the tech is at TRL 7.  On gov readiness side, they've got the basics covered with UEI and CAGE Codes but also have a contract vehicle.  They haven't been asked for TS clearance yet, but much of their full timers are previous military including one for Raytheon full timer.  They mentioned while their expertise is manned aircrafts mostly, they've been asked by the ARMY to work on UAS as well with the tech and gather data to be shared for future maintenance and repairs.  Recommending for invite as we don't have this space covered and their venture has good traction and gov readiness.   ",
      "Answer 1": "So we're specifically focused on helping people do a better job, of working better together with less effort. There are fewer people that want to maintain aircraft today in general, across the defense and commercial side of the industry, and of the people that are left, there's less and less institutional knowledge that remains because people get out. And so there are less qualified people to train the new people. And that cycle continues and continues. What we're doing is we're leveraging technology to automatically capture that institutional knowledge, tribal knowledge, as part of a product, so then people can just do their everyday jobs. And we are silently and quietly collecting in the background all the information about how long it takes to do certain jobs, who is the best type of person for this type of job. When we see this sort of fault code happen, how do we resolve this quickly? Right. So we're allowing the flight line maintenance, control, decision makers, supporting shops, etc. To be able to move faster together because they're not having to rediscover things for themselves. For the very first time, they can leverage the knowledge of the people that came before them in an institutional process so that the system as a whole can stay intelligent, even though individual players may be swapping in and out. We're very specifically focused on flight line coordination. How do we help that operation do a better job that way? That aircraft are highly available and yeah, so the name of the game for us is increase aircraft availability. We started with a commercial product, we've adapted this for defence needs, and so far we've had pretty good success inside of the Air Force, specifically the Air National Guard, working with the technology.",
      "Answer 2": "So we have around nine people today, seven FTEs and two contractors. We specifically started on the commercial side of the industry. So we went through a process called Hangar 51, which is a business accelerator run by International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways and like nine other carriers in Europe. So we deployed our technology out with them right before COVID hit and a fleet of aircraft in Barcelona. It's like 146 airplanes operating some 800 daily flights. That was wildly successful. Covid hit. We were very fortunate that we won a SBIR from AFWERKS to basically see if this headache that we solved for the commercial space is also a headache that we saw for the defence side. So afworks paid us 50 grand to go out and talk with people. That led to several Phase three contracts with multiple Air National Guard units. And that turned around and led to a $1.93 million SBIR Phase II contract with the National Guard Bureau of Majcom, where we're building out the quality assurance capabilities that layer on top of our existing thing to help the aircraft maintenance personnel. So we are in the process of moving forward with that Right now. That contract is active today, and the Air Force is already looking to extend this out for an additional phase three to roll this out to three units in an operational fielding. And then from there we expect to continue down to become a program of record.",
      "Answer 3": "I think we're in a pretty good place from a government readiness perspective. We do have personnel who are former military, so we absolutely can achieve security clearances. We have not had a need to go through that process ourselves, but I've got former Marines, former Air Force personnel on my staff. We're good to go with the sba. So, you know, we've got the SBA identifier, the CAGE code stuff. That's all well and good. Like I said in the previous video, we have achieved multiple contracts, phase one, phase two and phase three contracts through AFWorks. And then also we were awarded a slot on the Rapid Sustainment Office, part of the AFRL. They issued a multi award certificate IDIQ. So we want a slot on that to 960, $975 million IDIQ. So, you know, there's always opportunity for us to get better, but I think we're pretty well positioned so far. We've got a cyber security team, so we're working towards our authority to operate inside of the DOD's network. I think we should be able to achieve our interim authority to test pretty quickly, and then we're well positioned to go after that ato. Yeah. So like I said, there's always opportunity to improve, but I think that we've done a pretty good job getting to where we are without much guidance."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "Booked call for 2/6/25 @ 1000 EST\n\n2/6/25 - The venture, Zeromark mentioned that they knew Gu$ from NSIN Propel.  The venture is focussed on AI weapon sensing for counter UAV.  While some of the others we spoke to in this space are focussed on using jamming, spoofing, or expensive missiles, they are focused on using tech for rifle ammunition for counter drone attacks as it's more economical.  The tech is able to identify drone threats and take them out when applied to to autonomous or semi autonomous weapons it's applied to.  They're venture backed with $7M in funding and generating about 100k annually right now.  Critically focussed on DoD, the only commercial use cases are around security is energy and oil.  They are a part of 4 SBIR's for DoD.  The tech is at TRL 8 awaiting widespread to get to TRL 9.  The venture is in a good gov ready position with UEI, CAGE Code, Contract Vehicle and TS clearances pending.  Strongly recommending for invite as they'd be able to collaborate well with some of the drone builders we've already invited.  ",
      "Answer 1": "Hi, Joel Anderson Here with Zero Mark, we are building an intelligent platform and operating system for existing firearms. From shoulder fired rifles, to crew serve machine guns or turrets in the back of vehicles, to remote weapon stations like the Mark 38 and Mark 49 ROSAM that you might find on naval vessels. What we do is we provide passive sensing in mechanized aim augmentation or in some cases full automatic aiming capabilities to these existing weapon systems with really the intention or a couple use cases being counter UAS soldier lethality, or more broadly, network distributed strike capabilities across all those weapon platforms for coordination and precision fire effect. On top of the fun part, the auto aiming pieces, we also do threat analytics with our sensors. We can look at a drone in the counter UAS context and determine is it carrying a payload or is it just surveilling, is it a known drone? We can also kind of collate that or union that data with other systems and sensors on a broader network or command and control network. And we can also provide background our threat analytics on it. Additional things that we are solving is collateral prediction. You know, taking a drone out of the sky is one thing, but doing it in a way that is safe, especially in a domestic context or in an urban environment or in an area with sensitive assets like an airfield, is a complicated task. And we make sure that the operators, when they are behind the triggers of these systems to deal with the interdiction or the security of such a scenario, have the right decisions or the right information to make the right decisions at the right time. We also integrate more broadly with existing effectors such as coyotes and roadrunners and a variety of other systems, so that a command and control software itself can deliver the best effect and ultimately make it capable, make a single person capable of defending from a pretty sophisticated swath of threats that might be approaching them.",
      "Answer 2": "So ZeroMark is venture funded. We're backed by some pretty incredible venture partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Ground Up Ventures, Anorac Ventures and a few others. We are from a traction perspective we are in kind of early stages of production. We have one in open topic with afWorks, we've been brought into Insign, Propel and other accelerators and we also have a contract internationally with Singapore's home team technology team HTX for a use case that is for counter narcotic operations and kinetic drone interdiction. We have made some small scale sales to private military companies and are looking for kind of the next steps on export and demonstrations for both Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania and the IDF as well. We have a small task order for in terms of the company we are about two years old. We are 10 employees now full time, 14 total employees and are growing very quickly. We're prepping to go out for our Series A although that's not disclosed publicly and looking to really ramp things up from there.",
      "Answer 3": "So I think that's a pretty loaded question. How government ready are we? I've done extensive work both federally and with the DoD over many years in a variety of different industries. Former background in the Navy. We do understand the compliance requirements. We're certainly NIST 800171 compliant self certified wise. We've not had a need to go out for cmmc. We don't host services we build edge computing devices. So from a compliance perspective we're pretty well covered. We have our cage code, we've done active contracts, we've submitted invoices on pie and things of that nature but we don't have any have facilities clearance. That's just not the nature of the contracts that we've won at this point. But all in all I think we are pretty well versed in how to do business with the government. Certainly willing to learn more and need to learn more but I think we're in a good position to engage with the DOD and federal agencies.",

Their venture has developed a drone specially to be flown and landing in and over waters.  They are furthest along on a Group 2+ drone which has capabilities of landing in water if needed communicate in a stealth way with other drones such as Group 3 that they are developeing.  They've received 1.8M in funding recently from the Air Force to further develop their drones.  They're at a TRL 6 and plan to be at TRL 9 within just 2 quarters.  They are also making commercial traction in the off shore industry and off shore surveillance industry to further fund their defense initiatives.

Aerial drones have limited flight time and cannot float stably on the water. Even helicopters and seaplanes cannot land on the ocean and float in rough conditions. Subsea vessels and surface vessels can have endurance, but they are slow and need exists for the ability to persist on the surface of the ocean and then fly at high speed on demand. We're testing our Group 2/UAS Pro prototype right now. We're on track to do demonstrations to the DoD later this year at Gifix and Antechs. We've largely been self funded to date and are opening our pre seed round soon.",

      "Phone Interview Notes": "Booked for 3/21/25 @ 1200 EST\n\nThis venture is software focussed on taskable blue missions.  They write the software that is hardware agnostic for UAS missions using sensors and surveillance.  Their biggest movement is in the effectiveness of the autonomy and the UI they're using to make mission launch simple for the end user while offering real time diagnostics and reporting to the end user while in mission.  The team of 12 is heavy on software engineers and software developers with former millitary personal leading the biz dev side.  They've been awarded multiple SBIR's for a total nearing $1M and their core product is at a TRL 6.  We have several people committed to SigmaBlox that JUST make sensors or drone in a box that are looking to work with ventures like theirs, and I think they'd be a great addition to the cohort for that reason as well as a solid tech venture doing something meaningful to DoD in the UAS space.  Recommending for invite. ",
      "Answer 1": "Yes. Good morning. My name is Scott Campbell. I'm with Resilience Incorporated. We are based out of Syracuse, New York. We're a software company currently on contract with AFWorks and NASA to develop a digital infrastructure to enable advanced air mobility in a beyond visual line of sight environment. Our venture, and why I'm here with Sigma Blocks, is to see if we can get some interest with the DoD, particularly the air Force, to solve a problem of taskable blue UAs. In other words, friendly drones within a security environment like a base or a range operation, mainly for the Air force, but for DoD as well. How do we solve that? We pivot and we capitalize on the program we're doing with ATHWERX already, which enables that digital infrastructure. It enables a consortium of capability based on a software that's called In Time Aviation Safety Management System. So that's all the sensors tied together in this network. We monitor and issue fault mitigation. There's all kinds of different sensor capabilities that we bring to the table with this. But we'd like to really pivot this program from AF Works and NASA into a taskable blue UAS capability enabling autonomy on a base. So in other words, you could deploy a drone autonomously to a point in time and space based on a sensor hit, based on a emergency or a crisis or search and rescue use. Cases like that really, really are applicable to what we're trying to do. The program is called Orion. The optics program is the one we are completing with AFWorks and NASA right now. We would like to take that program and, and make it autonomous for blue drones in the future. For mainly Air Force again, but overall, the Department of Defense thank you.",
      "Answer 2": "So our traction with this is very good. As I mentioned, the optics program with AFWorks and NASA is ready to deploy after just over a year period of performance on a two year pop. We would like to pivot that, as I said, to that taskable Blue capability for the DOD and the Air Force. So we have about 12 employees right now with Resilience. We are a startup, we've been around for a while. I've been with them a little over a year and I'm helping them get into the Federal Government and DoD Mission Space. As you know, there's probably hundreds of use cases where drones can can benefit not only the military but on the commercial side. We are very heavy on the commercial side with advanced air mobility in some cities based on software. We're looking for funding to develop this program called Orion and it truly has a dual use capability. The military taskable Blue base security, range operations. And also on the dual use side for commercial, it enables drone as a first responder. Drone in a box. All of those use cases that apply in a regional municipal area also apply on the DoD mainly Air Force side. As I said for base security and range operations. Thank you.",
      "Answer 3": "We are government ready with the optics program. Again, AFWorks and NASA have funded this. It was awarded in November 2023, excuse me, November 2022. And we've been working on it ever since. We're ready to deploy. We have a demonstrable capability in Syracuse, New York in a corridor. And the concept, as I mentioned, the Orion concept that we're trying to get some traction with and we need some development funding for is that dual use, taskable, blue UAs. We're working with hardware suppliers, in other words the drone manufacturers, the US DIU shortlist type drone manufacturers to do this. We're talking to drone in a box. So we have everything kind of in place. We are agnostic to sensors, we're really agnostic to hardware as well. But the concept is TRL3 and we are really looking to get this thing some traction as far as the government is concerned. We are good to go on the optics side of things. You can find that on our website, resilience.com and you can also search it up with AffWorks and NASA under Resilience. So thank you very much Sigma Blocks, for letting me get in front of you. Look forward to hearing from you in the future. And we think this technology and capability is something that the government, DoD and Air Force can really use. Thank you."

They are VC-funded and focused on scaling their business, particularly by expanding connections within INDOPACOM and other DOD stakeholders. Their technology is highly developed, with telecom payloads ready for immediate deployment and aircraft anticipated to be operational later this year. The team consists of 10 experienced full-time employees, including those with $100M exits at Google and extensive aerospace expertise, and they are shifting focus towards business development.\n\nThey have strong traction, with over $100M in private-sector telecom contracts, including partnerships with AT&T, and 10 DOD contracts, including two Phase 2 SBIR awards at $1.5M each. Their proprietary technology is a key differentiator, and they have demonstrated adaptability, notably pivoting an 18-month telecom payload project to better address customer priorities. Their government readiness includes SAM.gov registration, a CAGE Code, and an existing contract vehicle, though they are at TRL-5/6 and do not yet have an ATO or security clearance. Given their advanced technology, strong commercial traction, and growing government presence, I recommend moving them to the next round."

Recommending for invite.  ",
      "Answer 1": "My venture is focused on creating sensors for the Internet industry of things and predictive maintenance solutions specifically for industrial sites such as physical plants, energy distribution, multimodal logistics I.e. ships, trucks, planes, etc. Basically anything that uses complex physical industrial systems as part of their normal business process. The market is over 70% of facilities and systems don't actively use predictive maintenance systems and 51% of that decision is due to cost. We intend to drive that down with different tiered solutions that basically work and don't require enterprise overview. At the VP level, the lack of these solutions result in downtime of 5 to 15% increase on faculties and systems, increase of up to 20% of labor cost. Also, labor could be put toward higher cognitive solutions for the business and return on investment and a 5 to 20% increase in inventory carrying costs, loss of productive asset use. Finally, most systems on average can lose over 200,000 a year due to downtime and that occurs usually once, roughly every quarter. That is a ship going down. Think of a cruise ship going down or a distribution center going down. We believe that by focusing on the four big pillars and deploying our systems thea automatically, we can reduce that downtime and do an immediate return on investment just on the first quarter alone.",
      "Answer 2": "We've already had a demonstration at the Naval Postgraduate School Joint Interagency Field Experiment, where we received wide feedback. Our next steps that we're waiting for some funding to do operations is to install it on two to five DoD systems. We're currently in negotiations with five DoD agents, and we're working with the Oklahoma Small Business Development center to get get in some commercial facilities, energy, energy distribution, and oil and gas. Just as a sidebar, I'm a retired colonel, so I was actually at Operational Energy Innovation, where we did portfolio managers across the Joint Force. So I do have a lot of inroads to this problem, both from an RDT and E research, development, and evaluation, and also, of course, operationally. So I've got some Inside access at DoD, and coming from Oklahoma, I do have some access within heavy industries themselves to use this.",
      "Answer 3": "Regarding the use of being ready for government. We do have a CAGE code, a UEI vosb. I've been registered and maintained with all the systems, so I'm legally compliant. Additionally, I do have a Top Secret clearance and a lot of my initial members that are going to be supporting the effort are retired reservists or near retired reservists with a secret or above security clearances. We do try to maintain a quick accordance with that and the FASB and the DOD OSD ANS Comptroller Standards.

      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/29/25 - Booked call for 1/30/25 @ 1700 EST\n\n1/30/25 - The venture as created a propulsion system through electro science that used electric coils and magnetics to propel objects without any expel.  With just 70k in bootstrap funding they've created a propulsion system with proof of concept hardware applications up to 30 lbs that they're hoping will be used in space but could have other applications as well.  Their main hurdle right now is 3rd party validation.  While many companies from universities to Lockheed and Raytheon have seen their tech in action  and expressed interest in the form of letters of support for the SBIR grant efforts, the fact of the matter is this tech is early on and needs a bit more validation before being used.  It's more ground breaking than it is validated at this stage with the founder and his partners focussing on building interest to get their SBIR grant $ to further their traction.  What they lack in traction, they've compensated for in iteration speed being able to develop an entirely new and patented propulsion system with just 70k funds.  The tech is at a TRL 5 right now with the venture having UEI and CAGE code.  They've had several papers published on their tech.  It's an early bet, but I think the tech is impressive enough to warrant an invite recommendation.",
      "Answer 1": "Hey, how are you? My name is Ed Chen. My venture name is Emsektet. And what we are is a thruster propulsion technology company. I invented a reactionless drive, which is an engine which produces thrust and propulsion without expelling propellant or needing a propeller. So basically, what this does is it replaces the rocket engine in space. It allows us to have unlimited maneuverability, maneuver without regret in space. But also it has marine applications. It's almost strong enough to compete with the propeller motor that we use in marine applications. And so it'll give us new maneuverability underwater and on the surface of the water as well. Also be utilized for a braking system, because we no longer have to have frictional contact with the surface of the roads. So basically, it will change the paradigm of propulsion. One of our challenges is it challenges the laws of physics. So a lot of physicists don't believe what they're seeing or feeling. But, you know, we can demonstrate it on pretty much every surface. In the air, on the water. And now we solve it by using electromagnetic coils arranged in a way which allows us to circumvent some of the traditional understandings of Newton's third law, which is every conservation of momentum, linear momentum in particular, by converting the linear momentum into angular momentum electromagnetically. So, yeah, so this will allow new maneuverability for everything from our propulsion vehicles to potentially cruise missiles, aircraft and satellites.",
      "Answer 2": "Our company has been around for about a year now and we've gotten some traction. We have two papers published by the Society of Automated Engineers. We have started a partnership with NPS Naval Postgraduate School, participating in a number of their events with their students. We have begun to network with people at Raytheon, Lockheed Martin. We have a letter of support from spacecom, and we are part of a defense Accelerator quest held by htdc, the Hawaii Technology Development Company, as well as the Maui Economic Development Board, which hosts a space accelerator. We're partnered with the Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory to validate our technology from a third party source, and we have some interest with additional employees, but we don't have anyone employed yet. The paper that describes the thruster technology won one of the best technical papers for SAE and was published in their academic journal and will be participating at Spacecom, PostFX and GIFX.",
      "Answer 3": "I don't have security clearance currently, but I've gone through some of that process. I'm confident that I can get one. We have a new UEI cage code, we have a contract vehicle and so we're relatively government ready. Not fully incorporated yet because we haven't taken any investors. I've been self funded, but that's a pretty quick process to do."

      "Answer 1": "Hi. Affiliate Aerospace is a space propulsion company that is commercializing space propulsion systems to power satellites, moon landers and even launch vehicles. And the secret sauce with Affiliate Aerospace is its eco friendly fuel formula that uses to power these satellites. It's a technology that was originally developed at Sedilla National Labs with Department of Energy to look at alternatives of replacing hydrazine, a very toxic fuel that's used to power satellites. It's the most common fuel right now for satellites. And now we have something that's a good eco friendly alternative. And we have already tested the rocket engines with this fuel, the fuel formula. We have it all understood. We have filed two patents and now we are starting to commerc actual fully integrated propulsion systems to power satellites, launch vehicles, landers. But we're starting with SBE class satellites because those are the ones that benefit the most early on from these propulsion systems that we have and also where we are noticing the greatest demand in that sector. And these propulsion systems will be again in direct competition with hydrogen based propulsion systems. And it's becoming, it's clear that we have a big advantage compared to nitrous oxide based propulsion systems or ammonia based systems. Even compared to the Ascent, the AFRL based Ascent, ours is actually a higher energy version and it could be complementary to the other system.",
      "Answer 2": "We have two patents filed for our fuel formula. One is a bipropellant fuel formula and then the other one is a mixed motor propellant fuel formula. We have had government contracts in the past. These were SBIRs and we have applied for three SBIRs. Right now we're ready to hear back. We are in communication with AFRL and they have expressed interest, strong, strong interest for our propulsion technology especially for high energy orbit transfer maneuvers like carrying large payloads, transferring payloads between Earth orbits and the moon. And we got a customer memorandum last year for the direct to phase two proposal. But overall we also have an IDIQ contract worth over 2.5 million with one of the DoD organizations. Overall we have I believe over 30 million in pending contracts. This is in the form of RFQs, Lois Mous, things like that. We have a total of over 1.5 billion in future business opportunities and a lot of this again, Lois Mous, this is based on actual customer engagements.",
      "Answer 3": "Yeah, Our company is ready to do business with the government. We do have a cage code. And again, we have applied for sbirs in the past. We have won sbirs in the past. And we do have an IDIQ with an organization within dod. And we are all US persons, especially US Citizens in our team. We do have people with security clearances and some with top secret clearance. So we are, we can support the US Government right away."

      "Video Notes": "Venture autonomously removes debris from runways.  Little traction and basic gov readiness only.  Extending a call to hopefully learn something more valuable.  ",
      "Phone Interview Notes": "The venture created an autonomous robotics system and reporting software to clear Foreign Object Debris (FOD) off of runways, tarmacs, and aircraft carriers.  The venture has 4 co founders all with backgrounds in previous successful startups, and their experience lies heavy in autonomous driving engineering, robotics engineering, and software engineering.  With a small Pre Pre Seed raise of 125k, they moved to an official pre seed raise of 1.5M after building their first prototype, and they built/tested it FAST.  The unit moved through the runway picking up FOD at a 99% accuracy rate without having to use the antiquated resources of a shoulder to shoulder FOD walk of the personnel.  The machine than analyzes what type of debris it picked up to mitigate and large expenses to aircrafts in the future.  For example, if it's picking up mostly wood from pallets, the decision could be made to use plastic pallets, if it's picking up aircraft carrier debris, the debris is identified and all aircraft personnel that was on the runway from the last sweep is notified.  They've build out a custom software for all of the analysis that is also automated to lessen the labor burden and provide a cost savings to aircrafts.  Their biggest challenge right now is going through the FAA compliance process for widespread adoption.  They are working with smaller and private airports where the compliance is lessened to make sure they keep their traction going and once they get their compliance, it's likely to have mass adoption as they've patented both the software and hardware for use.  They've done all of this very quickly given their backgrounds and experience in the startup world.  Recommending for invite.  ",
      "Answer 1": "Hi, did you know that the small debris on the airfield, like screws or even small rocks, can be detrimental to aircraft safety because when they get sucked into the jet engines, it can severely damage the aircraft. These things are called foreign object debris. And an FAA estimates that it cost nearly $23 billion in annual losses. Military aviation suffer from the same problem as well. In fact, this can be more critical to them because the foreign object debris can compromise the mission readiness. Actually, the fire jets like F15 or F22 that has the lower engine positions closer to the ground, are particularly more susceptible to the debris damages. So to mitigate this risk, the current method that the defense sector is employing is the manual method called the FOD walks. So the service members line up shoulder to shoulder, walk the entire flight line and remove the pick up the other foreign object debris. And this is, as you can imagine, highly inefficient and the very much prone to the human error. So our solution is basically a robot cleaner for our defense sector that goes out and autonomously detects, removes and reports foreign object debris from the flight line. So by providing 24, seven consistent inspections and cleaning, our solution can reduce the risk of foreign object debris and enhance the operational efficiency and improve the mission readiness for our defense sector.",
      "Answer 2": "We have a functioning prototype at technology readiness level. At technology readiness level 7. We conducted a pilot at Grand Rapid Airport in Michigan last year and we're conducting another pilot at Lumpkin Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio this year. We're on track to three plus pilots this year across the different airports and the different states, and we are leveraging these opportunities to validate our product and advanced to the product readiness to serve our initial customers. We have a patent pending at the USPTO at this moment and we've raised $125,000 and we're currently raising $1.5 million pre seed round, the 30% of which have been committed.",
      "Answer 3": "We have registered@sam.gov so we have a UEI number and a CAGE code and also we have submitted CBIR proposal before the Phase one open topic for Air Force. But regarding the in terms of the security clearance, we don't really have anything at this moment, so it'd be great to have some help and a support on that."

      "Video Notes": "Maritime comms for INDOPACOM, decent traction, very targeted tech for INDOPACOM, need to learn more with a call. ",
      "Answer 1": "Well, our venture is Mariner SIM and it's basically a maritime communication training for indopacom. The reason is that the forces that are in indopacom they face a documented critical vulnerability where operators lack effective training for maritime specific RF radio frequency communication challenges. When electronic warfare signally incurs in the maritime environments, the US forces experience communication breakdowns and restoring it can sometimes take up to four plus hours, which is unacceptable. The existing communication training fails to address the unique physics of the maritime RF propagation and that leaves the operators unprepared for the phenomena they currently that consists and that consistently they encounter in the real world in the Indo PACOM region. So our solution is Mariner sim, the Maritime Advanced RF Intelligence Network Enhancement and Reliability Simulator. What it does is it delivers specialized training that prepares the operators to anticipate, identify and mitigate the maritime communication failures. What happens is that it reduces the restoration time from four plus hours to hopefully 30 minutes. The key operational capabilities are number one, maritime specific RF propagation simulation, number two, progressive training scenarios, number three, expeditionary deployment capabilities enabling just in time training for the forces, rapid scenario customization, fully offline operation in contested environments, low resource requirements that are designed for tactical edge deployment on the existing hardware so you don't need expensive new software.",
      "Answer 2": "So we do consider ourselves a startup still. However, we've been working for the past five years, out of which two years were during COVID because that's where we started, which was like approximately two months before COVID So touch wood, we're still here. We've been profitable for a number of years. As for revenue, like I said, we've been profitable and hopefully this year will continue. Awards, employees and funding. We are bootstrapped. We have not taken any kind of venture capitalist funding and the reason for that is that we don't want to mess up the ethos of the company, which is people first, then planet, then profit. And our entire focus is on the war fighter and helping them in that regard. We did not get funding for this. However, we have put in proposals in collaboration with MIT and another private company that's well established. We've put it in for DARPA, we put it in for ExTech, the Army applications, and we've also put it in for SOCOM and one other challenge. And of course here at Sigma Blocks, we're hoping that we can get this off the ground and in their hands very rapidly because we are keeping it low tech so that it can be delivered to them at the edge in their contested environments.",
      "Answer 3": "We're a government defense contractor. So our entire focus currently is on GovCon, and specifically on DoD and the DHS, the Department of Homeland Security. As for security clearance, the entire company doesn't have security clearance, but a lot of our individuals have varying clearances, from secret all the way up to tssci. Yes, we have a UEI number, we have a DUNS number. We have a CAGE code. We have contract vehicles, and we also have and if there's a contract vehicle we need and do not have, there are a lot of companies that we collaborate with that say that we are allowed to use their contract vehicles as well. So that should not be a problem. We are also on some research contract vehicles with gtri, Georgia Tech Research. So in this regard, we're good to go."

They've been focused on UAV and space for fire control and payload missions.  Their main value add is an easy to read UI that takes millions of data points through LLM and puts them into actionable steps for the operator, and they've developed alot quickly since they founded 3 years ago.\n\nTheir main customer has been NASA and the insurance industry for their wild fire control.  They have a great dual use case with revenues at 1.7M in these industries just in the past year.\n\nThey've been a part of multiple SBIR's and are currently in a Phase 3 SBIR with the air force.\n\nThe team of 11 is primarily focussed on software engineering and cloud architecture while their bizdev could use a little help in the gov sector which is why they are interested in a program like this.  They are also a sub contractor for prime OWT where they've gained access to classified facilities to work in.\n\nRecommending for an invite. ",
      "Answer 1": "When war fighters are sent to the battlefield, they have a lot of different resources, a lot of different sensors, and a lot of different vehicles that all provide data in the field. However, this is raw data. It's not actionable information, it's not standardized, it comes from multiple different sensors and it's not fused and it doesn't provide any context. So end users, operators, war fighters, they cannot make informed decisions because they don't have actionable intelligence. Skytel is improving aviation platform and we connect to the sensors on the edge, the vehicle, autonomous aerial vehicles, autonomous surface vehicles, vehicle detection sensors, and we fuse all that data in a single place to provide standardized, normalize actionable information so that users can perform unbiased and educational and informed decisions that are going to allow us to take the next step. Our technology is hardware agnostic and uses a proprietary data ingestion pipeline and modular software architecture so that we can synthesize all the data that comes from the different sensors and provide unbiased data to the operator, removing false positives, removing duplicates, and providing context to the data using all the information that we are collecting on the field so that operators can make the best decisions and enhance mission effectiveness and ensure mission success.",
      "Answer 2": "I started this venture as a solo founder in three years ago. It all started with a grant from NASA to do the development of the Skytel platform for Wildfire operations. Since then we have moved beyond our SBIR Phase 2 with NASA to provide management of main and maintenance vehicles during Wildfire operations and we have also deployed our Wildfire platform commercially and it's been being used by several state organizations and private commercial partners. And since then we have adapted this platform to be used not only for Wildfire operations but for battlefield operations. So we are right now working on a direct to Phase two with the Air Force to do drone detection and autonomous drone management and we have also been expanding to model other natural disasters, other autonomous vehicle operations and we have won several awards with NASA and NOAA beyond that to enhance the autonomous capabilities of our platform for development and deployment into more advanced scenarios. We right now are a team of 11 people and we have been backed by ventures such as Google as a champion for how to use AI processing in technology.",
      "Answer 3": "All our technologies have been raised with government funding from the Sabre program. We had gone through several Sabre grants from NASA, NOAA and the Air Force and we are government ready. We are compliant with accounting systems, time tracking, we have all our UAE numbers, cage and code in place and we are becoming more and more aware of how to develop and how to obtain CMMC or cybersecurity certification facility clearances and how to work with government stakeholders so that we can hopefully get sponsored in future for additional security clearances or facility clearances."

They've identified the main problem with current semi conductors when it comes to coms as being too slow, unreliable, or in the event of space, not being able to withstand radiation and outright failing.  Through more than 9 patents, they've developed semi conductor tech using carbon nano tubes to optimize all communication, reliability , and speed.  With just 600k in funding over the past few years they've moved pretty fast in their space with their main dual use case business being working with semi conductor manufacturers who's end users are in everything from cell phones to RF products and their secondary business being the public sector working as a sub contractor.  They have a small full time team right now that's mostly focussed on the hardware engineering side and the tech is at TRL 4 awaiting adoption.  They've identified one of their biggest problems as needing to know how to navigate the DoD space which is an area we can help with.  They have one Phase 1 SBIR which they are expecting a phase 2 as well.  We spoke mostly about how this tech could be used in more reliable communication with UAS but also specifically in Space.  Radiation compromising  semi conductors in space has been a big problem which leads to communication failure or very slow unreliable communication.  Their semi conductor hardware they believe has the solution for this.  There are alot of coms ventures in SB, but no one specifically that focusses on the semi conductor portion of the problem and I think they'd make a great addition to round out that portion of the community.

      "Answer 1": "Yeah, I just want to take a second and just tell you how excited I am to apply to this. I did apply to the Beta Blocks program, so Sigma Blocks is much more up my alley. I have worked in the defense contractor space for an engineering firm, and currently the technology that we're working on is autonomous ground vehicles, which will have relevant applications for the military. It's something that's on our roadmap, so this could be a really great opportunity for all of us.",

So I did a Master's of Science in Ag business and I'm a doctoral candidate at George Fox University. So that's a doctorate of Business Administration with an emphasis in data analytics. In general. I like to do CrossFit, love to snowboard, looking for fresh pow pow. I'm a father, I'm a husband, so just kind of a full life. And I'm a faith based entrepreneur, so I'm a Christian entrepreneur."

R&D is workin on long range flying to be deployed from a remote site, then be able to land on the ground as well.  It was a payload capacity to carry away threats as well.  Commercial viability includes uses from inspections on gas and oil as well as power.  They are using the commercial traction to fund more defense needs.  The company has a CAGE code already and a contract vehicle.  They said they have the ability to work with a classified facility with the right clearances (to me that just means they know of one).  They have not been required to get security clearance yet but are at a TRL 5.  Given the scale they're using, they anticipate to be at TRL 8 within 3 months and gov ready for their robotic tech to be used in 6 months.  I am recommending them for an invite to the incubator.

      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/30/25 - Carolina Unmanned has a balloon aerostat system that they can deploy with absolute minimal manpower being able to be deployed by only 1 or 2 people.  They've contracted directly with the Army and have subbed with Lockheed and Raytheon.  The company has been around for sometime now as a staples in surveillance but in the age of drone tech, they find themselves being the differentiator to work in tandem with new drone tech.  He explicitly cited not wanting to play directly in the drone space but work along with those applications in their weaknesses.  Drones have a minimum flight time due to power capacity, payload capacity and limitations in communication.  They've been contracting their deployable balloon aerostat system to be the \"rock\" that drone tech needs such as fueling, communication, and a payload point.  The balloons carry a much higher payload capacity and can fly for 3-5 days before only needing 30 mins to come to the ground to be refueled making them a steady contact point to refuel drones, act as a payload pickup point, or an in air flight command for communications to drones being developed today.  Their patented deployable system is at TRL 8 which has given them a great position to contract with large DoD prime contractors.  Mike stated, we aren't the payload tech, but rather the dependable carrier for the cutting edge tech being developed.  This balloon tech is not something new.\n Much of it has been used overseas for years..many of which were their contracts.  But, seeing this staple used to carry the cutting edge tech that we need in the air is where I think the value is.  Someone like this would be a great collaborator with people we've talked to that are developing laser tech refueling system, com systems, and payload providers for drones to carry their tech where it needs to be.  Recommending for invite. ",
      "Answer 1": "My name is Mike Rogers. I'm from Carolina Unmanned Vehicles. We build the expeditionary aerostat system. This is a tactical mobile aerostat system. A tethered balloon system is designed for 24,7 persistent operation with very low manpower, very low cost and the ability to be relocated as required. We use a aerostat that has incorporated aerodynamic lift so that it will stay aloft in winds that normally aerostats of our size will not operate in. This in turn allows us, with a smaller aerostat to build a system mounted on a home V trailer. C130 roll on, roll off capability in 30 minutes. From rolling off of a C130, you can have a 60 mile communication zone or an electronic intelligence collection capability surveillance system out to the limits of the camera. And even with one version, a radar system to detect incoming cruise missiles, drones and other threats. We have designed the system so that it is able to use very low manpower. You can't operate it with two people. Typically you would need a little bit more. Partly because you need someone for 24, 7 coverage. Of the various sensors that may be employed, it may use. We can very readily adapt different sensors. We have in fact, on testing, changed from one payload sensor to another type in less than two minutes. The real purpose of the system though, is to elevate electronics of various types and maintain it elevated 24 hour, seven days a week, multiple days. We believe this system can enhance air defense, electronic intelligence and forward communications. Thank you.",
      "Answer 2": "The expeditionary Aerostat system that we are currently design and producing is a derivative of a number of SBIR contracts, Army Air Force, even some subcontracts with Navy and these led us to build prototypes and systems that were suitable for deployment but did not directly lead to deployment. However the systems were then bought by the rapid equipping force. U.S. army Rapid Equipping Force 8 systems built, 7 deployed to Afghanistan we have taken the baseline design from the Afghanistan deployment and made various improvements including the ability to move with the trader with the Aerostat aloft to cover different types of payloads to be able to carry larger payloads. Through a two trailer combination we can carry many different types of payloads. These may include radars and we're in partnering with other companies that have available radars, communications, electronic intelligence counter, uas, electronics both for detection and jamming. We are building each system has been built on the preceding successful operations so that our current system is very flexible in terms of design and capability.",
      "Answer 3": "Carolina Unmanned Vehicles has had numerous government contracts, in fact some dating back to 1995. We have active registration on SAM.gov we have produced items for the Army. In production. We have produced test articles for the Air Force as well as building units in house and leasing them to various defense contractors. We do not have a current security clearance, although we do have partner companies in the area. If we had to work in the classified area, we could utilize their facilities. We are working with a number of other companies who have the various payloads that can be employed with our system. Radars, electronic warfare, counter, uas. In most cases, the payloads would be the part that contained any kind of classified information so that work would have to be done at their facilities. I myself am retired Air Force. I was cleared for very very high material in the Air Force, but that is not active. I presume it could be made reactive again if required. We are also fortunate to be in the area of Fort Liberty where we can tap into the retiring army people with various clearances if contract requires it. We believe we can handle both classified and UN."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "Booked for 3/4/25 @ 1030 EST\n\nThe venture is dual use with it's main focus on developing software for marine vessels to operate autonomously.  They've made great traction in the commercial space and have done so fast by leveraging their dual use case.  They've generated a few million in revenue rather fast by providing hydrographic surveys of bodies of water around the world for their commercial customers, then using the data of those surveys to develop their autonomous marine vessel software.  To date, they've successfully tested their tech and put it into use with logistics companies and energy providers, and would like to bring the tech to DoD focussed in INDOPACOM.  With seed funding of $5M, they put a team of software engineers and marine experts in place to very quickly get to a level of successful testing that others have not been able to do in years with much better funds.  They are passionately driven to solve this problem for commercial and DoD as the applications for autonomous marine vessels put anyone using them in a very advantageous position with many possibilities.  While they've got the tech figured out better than most in this space, it's widely being deployed commercially and they have their sights set on DoD with little connection so they are eager to get into a program like ours.  Right now, they're working with a few primes that could not solve this issue as fast as them, and they're ready to bring the solutions to the military faster.  They have UEI, Cage Code, and a contract vehicle in place, but need better connections to DoD to get their tech implemented.  I think they'd be a great addition to SigmaBlox to offer more collaboration for companies trying to solve the same problem and also get them the visibility they need to get the tech into DoD.",
      "Answer 1": "We are a software company that also does robotics hardware as needed. We are creating self driving for marine vessels. Self driving and automation for marine vessels in the commercial space. Automation in this industry is important for safety and for efficiency. Primarily for safety, but also for efficiency we're working on. The ocean is one of the most dangerous places. It's dangerous and unpredictable and there are a lot of fatalities. Many accidents that happen on the water are a result of human error. And really that's where robotics and automation, that's a great place for robotics and automation to step in and help. So you start first with with assist, with driver assist and then work towards full control later. We started as with a small 26 foot vessel that does hydrographic survey work in and around ports and marine highways. And we have expanded to larger vessels in the commercial space to include or to soon to include thousand foot tankers and bulk carriers. We automate processes that humans find difficult, such as judging the distance to a dock and then we incorporate these automations into our pilot assist for a holistic automation approach.",
      "Answer 2": "We have been at this for over three years now. We currently have eight employees. They are mostly software developers. We also have a few on the ground engineers, and we also wear a lot of hats around here. We've only taken a moderate amount of seed funding so far, but we are currently looking to raise Series A investment. So if you know anybody, we've done about 800k in revenue for the past 12 months, and we are currently on track to triple that in the next 12 months. We are working primarily with Gulf coast ports, so anywhere from Florida to Texas generally. We've also worked with recreational marine companies and marine shipping companies, and we are currently still working with those. And there's a few other things kind of in the mix right now, so we would love to get some traction in the defense domain as well.",
      "Answer 3": "We, we, none of us currently have security clearance. I'm pretty sure everybody on the team has had security clearance in the past. Maybe one person has not, so that shouldn't be a difficult hurdle. We do have, you know, UEI numbers, cage codes, and we actually have a contract vehicle as well, but we've never actually used it. We got everything ready to go to work with the Army Corps of Engineers, but we never actually did do any work there. We ended up changing from Army Corps to the ports directly. So. Yeah, but we are, we are, I would say, moderately ready to work with the government. We, we're actually currently looking into export laws as well. So we've, we've done, we've done a lot of the footwork that needs to be done to work with, with governments, but we have not actually done any work yet."

The drone flies around the aircraft pre or post mission to conduct the assessment, and they've build out an entire platform to analyze the results as well.  The tech is currently at a TRL 8 and able to analyze 15 types of aircrafts with a great commercial use base for 737's.  They've also using it on DoD aircrafts through their SBIR contract award.  They've conducted about 10k inspections using the tech and beyond proof of concept trying to eclipse the market with their tech.

Our venture is looking to help maintain the safety of flight and really augment the aircraft's general visual inspection process. Currently it is done with man in the loop intensive processes in which there are guys on scaffolding with pens and paper that go around and try to assess the damage on the exterior of an aircraft. We have designed and in house autonomous drone that's built with COTS products that are NDA compliant in which the drone flies around using a LIDAR based navigation system and a 4K camera to gather data on the outside of the aircraft and then feed that through some AI algorithms to assess what type of damage is on which part of the aircraft. Additionally, our operation is simple. We understand that our customers won't want to be or need to be drone experts. And so the setup process is as simple as you take it out of the box. It's a little three foot by three foot drone. You set it near the aircraft and it assesses where it's at in relation to that object and then uses one of the pre planned flight paths to navigate around the outside of the aircraft. And due to our LIDAR navigation system, we're able to keep a tight 10 meter distance from that and operate either in GPS denied or with GPS operations. So we can operate in contested environments as needed. And then since it comes in a pelican case to travel with, it's able to be taken on to expedient basing initiatives or to austere locations that don't have the typical support equipment to conduct inspections.",

We have about 100,000 in revenue since inception, which is late 2023 and have accrued about 550,000 in funding so far and are looking to actually start a raise here soon. And then Additionally we have 12 employees and are looking for some part time workers here and there as we as we need spot allocations.",
      "Answer 3": "Our company is pretty ready for a government venture. We're fully set up in sam, as in have a UEI and a CAGE code. We have a current contract vehicle which is a SBIR with Warner Robins and looking to turn that into more. We do not have a security clearance currently we're looking to partner with a prime whenever that comes time to do that. As my time at Lockheed Martin tells me that it's no small task to get one, maintain one and have a secured area to operate in. We've done a NIST assessment and we believe that we're at a good point for the stage of our venture. And also our product is designed to be portable, it's fairly weather resistant, it travels in a pelican case, loads up onto, you know, any, any sort of cargo aircraft that's needed. It's also designed to work in offline mode, so you just give it a go command and everything is resident on the drone during the inspection process. We've got wi fi and ethernet offload depending on security requirements. And then also our back end analysis platform is containerized on Fedramp cloud, which means that it can be put on any network as long as there's compute and storage that it can connect to. So that way it can be on whatever level of classified or unclassified or air gapped network it needs to be."

They've been a sub contractor for primes like Lockheed Martin and other defense tech companies.  The patents they have are on how the back end tech interfaces with the end user to make the execution simple enough to understand without a tech background.  Ultimately, building a mission planning and compliant platform for hardware to communicate in radio denied areas is where their traction is.  Iteration speed is about 1-2 months from an MVP after they're given direction because most of the legwork is already done and just awaiting the specs needed for a custom project.  They're doing a few hundred thousand commercially in finance and medical to further their R&D for DoD applications.  Has been required to get CAGE code, contract vehicle in the past, but will require another one for this specific application.\n They mentioned they are familiar with the process and have had to work out of a classified facility for their sub contracts in the past.\n Recommending for an invite."

      "Answer 1": "Hi, my name is Steve Boyle and I am the CEO and founder of Essential Aero. And as you can see, I probably should have done this video yesterday. I'm at south by Southwest and had a, had a lime scooter accident last night. So I'm not looking my best. But Essential Aero is a robotics company focused on aviation. So we help automate flight line operations. We're starting with fod. So foreign object debris, the debris that can be ingested into engines and damage engines, damage parts, decrease the safety of the surface. This particular use case is dual use. There's civilian airports also have fog control issues and they invest millions every year in FOD control. So we have a robot system we created. It can go out and sweep the pavement automatically without any supervision. It's systematic. It's route is planned programmatically. So it hits every square centimeter of pavement that it's, that it's been assigned to, which is very different than what you can do with humans. It's very hard for humans to be able to cover acres and acres of pavement with no markings and also be able to go out, want to go out and do that stuff when in adverse weather conditions and maybe even in adverse environments. So we're focused on these kinds of use cases. We also have another Air Force use case that is a flight line logistics use case. So these things, these, these are very turnkey, single button operation kind of robot systems that are autonomous don't require any humans. So we can, we're actually a way to lever, leverage the workforce and give a force multiplier, which is something that the Air Force and other civilian airports are looking for these days.",
      "Answer 2": "So we have, we took in some angel funding about three years ago, about 500K. And we've been running the company on FAA task order contracts and US Air Force super contracts over the, over the past two and a half, three years as we developed the product, all that money has been invested in product development. And now we have our first use case, which is this FOD control system that's ready to go to market. We're working with the Air Force to figure out how to move it to phase three, which would be a fantastic place for us to get some help from. Sigma blocks any connectivity into the DOD that has airfields. Right now we're only with Air Force, but there's obviously other branches that can use this kind of a technology. We've been invited to two Air Force showcases, challenge showcases. We've, we've got a patent on the fog collection system and we're going to go out and raise a seed round here imminently. We're already preparing and starting to talk to potential lead investors. We have a lot of followers, but you know that we need to find that one lead investor and maybe that's potentially a place where we can get some help from you guys as well. So we have, we have very tight relationships with universities, so we get research done for very inexpensively and a lot of other things.",
      "Answer 3": "So we are already working with the government. We're working with the two largest aviation operators in the world, the US Air Force, and also the faa. So for the FAA we created, they actually contracted us to create an inspection system based on drones to inspect ILS's and VGSIS, which are the lighting systems that pilots use to land airplanes on the end of the Runway. The those lighting systems. So we did all of that. We are well positioned to have that business with the FAA when they can decide that they want to move to something more than just discussions, which if you work with the faa, you know, there's lots of discussions. We're, we're already working with Luke Air Force Base. We're at, in talks with afworks at many different levels trying to figure out how to move our use cases. Our, we have, we had a couple of direct to phase 2s. We're trying to figure out how to move those direct to phase 2s into either attack PHI or a phase 3. So those are the, those are the types of activities that we're working on now. Our FOD control system we believe is TRL, TRL 8 level. So ready to go. We're already marketing it in a very friendly way to our early adopters on the west coast, which is where we're from. And we're operating at a couple of airports there now. And we're looking for more customers. But we're going to raise around here imminently to go at the market in a real way because we have no sales or marketing right now."

      "Answer 1": "Hey there. I am the founder and CEO of MOTA Bera. We are a spin out from the University of Wisconsin that's commercializing a new type of electric motor and drive system that is unique. It has a lot of advantages. And so the problem that we're trying to solve here is specifically in industrial and commercial turbo machinery. So these are generally large or high speed compressors, turbines, for example, in the H Vac industry, water chillers, heat pumps, oil and gas processing, wastewater blowers. And these applications, these systems, these motors and drives which form the core of the system, they have reliability issues. And so that comes in the bearings that support the part that spins. And the reliability issues can be removed and addressed if you remove those bearings. And so what motorbara is trying to do is create motors that integrate the capabilities of the bearing into the motor. And so it's called a bearing assist or bearing less motor. And the way we solve this is by designing these motors. They're specially designed. There's special windings and copper and cross sectional design and electronics control algorithms. All these come together to create a motor that can levitate the part that spins, so so you don't have to have any bearings, and that increases the reliability significantly. And this can be useful across a range of applications.",
      "Answer 2": "So in terms of our traction, we are pretty early on. So the company was founded by me about, about six months ago. We got into the Activate program. So I'm a fellow as part of Activate and so that's been really exciting. That's allowed me. So I finished my PhD about a year ago and now and going full time into this company. So from a revenue perspective we don't have any revenue. We are, we're just getting going here. In terms of funding and current plans. We have the Activate funding so there's some pre seed money and there's some R and D money there that's we're currently on. So we have a lab space, we have office to work out of, some computers and resources to build prototypes and then we have a lot of grants under review. So these are grants from the federal government that will fund demonstrators. In terms of IP and patents, there's seven patents from the University of Wisconsin that are owned at Wisconsin that potentially could be useful. But these are our secondary ip. So our core IP is really the trade secrets of how to create this type of motor. But we're considering licensing IP from the university and then also trying to file our own patent at Motora for some more customer focused ip.",
      "Answer 3": "In terms of the government readiness of the venture. We've applied for several. I've applied for several grants, SBIR grants, Department of Energy grants through the startup, through Motive era. So we have a UEI number. We have a cage code. I do not have security clearance. I do not have a contract vehicle. So I think that we're relatively early on the government side, but definitely going down the pathway of government funding through grants. But. But haven't looked a lot into the defense side. So it's mostly been NSF and doe, potentially NASA also. So. So, yeah, trying to figure out how to get into the Department of Defense side to get some more funding to pursue this venture."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "3/8/25- booked call for 3/10/25 at 10:00EST\n\n3/10/25- Nebula has developed a  technology designed to streamline and significantly reduce the cost of preparing components for space missions. Currently, every item sent into space must undergo individual hardening, rigorous vibration testing, and protection from radiation and thermal exposure\u2014a process that takes up to a year and costs millions. Nebula\u2019s solution\u2014a protective enclosure that can safeguard multiple components simultaneously\u2014has the potential to accelerate this process, lower costs, and improve efficiency. Instead of waiting a year for a processor that costs $1 million and is already outdated, their innovation allows for faster, more cost-effective deployment.\n\nWith $1.2M in SBIR funding and an additional $75K NASA prize, Nebula has made strong progress, though they have yet to generate commercial or government revenue. Their team of 12 full-time employees is actively focused on refining the technology, which is largely \"off-the-shelf\" ready but still undergoing testing. They hold patents on their technology and have already secured a contract vehicle with the government. While their Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is currently assessed at 4/5, they have experience working in classified facilities and are well-positioned to scale.\n\nGiven their innovative approach, strong technical foundation, and potential to revolutionize the space-hardening process, it is recommended to move them forward."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/3/25 - Booked Call for 1/8/25 @ 1100 EST.\n\n1/8/25 - Sunnoo's tech is a grid independent solar mobile deployable powersource to recharge or power applications in the field.  Commercially they apply this to businesses looking to offer EV charging for cars.  They've developed a defense product which can be hitched to a vehicle or placed on an aircraft carrier to setup a charging point anywhere for UAS system.  It can also power datacenters at sea or any mission points around a battlefield.  The defense product is outfitted with armor to protect against war time elements.  They have a few different products which all relate to the speed of charging and recharging as well as the amount of power it can support, and the units can be daisy chained together to support larger outfits or multiple outfits in close proximity.  The tech is built and ready to be deployed to anyone who purchases within 2 months.  Iteration and customization time is 2 months to 1 year depending on the specs needed.  They lagged a little bit in gov readiness, and only have the very basics covered.  They're currently funded by about 700k and raising another million or so to shorten their deploy time for orders and use.  This grid independent solar provider is built in the USA.  Recommending an invite because the tech seems valuable for defense tech, and they need a little help in being gov ready which the incubator should be able to help with.  I also think they'd be able to collaborate well with companies doing UGS to further enhance the deployment of their units.   ",
      "Answer 1": "Hello, my name is Chris Langathianis. I am a partner and CEO of sanu. We have developed a grid independent American made utility patented micro grid system. We also use it for commercial and consumer applications as a EV charger. That's our sexy product. In tandem with developing that though, we have developed a military version as well. So a lot of people don't realize that there are already a number of military applications for electric vehicles because they offer better stealth operations, they're quieter, they offer energy independence if you're able to charge in the field. Stealth, basically stealth operations. They're quieter than combustion engines and they provide a strategic advantage in some circumstances. They can be land vehicles. They can also be used electric vehicles as drones. So there are a lot of applications when it comes to the military. Unlike our consumer or commercial unit, our military style is built with bullet resistant solar array decks, has a secure battery cabinet and an airless tire system for enhanced durability and mobility. Our solar deck includes advanced cloaking and ST stealth capabilities, enabling it to dynamically match ground terrain colors in real time for optimal camouflage. It's designed for rapid deployment. It can transition between travel and setup modes in just 90 seconds, delivering seamless power capabilities in either configuration. Additionally, our units can be daisy chained together to create expandable power networks, offering unparalleled versatility and scalability. In short, our unit isn't just for EVs, it basically is an emergency or field power supply unit for our military.",
      "Answer 2": "Our microgrid unit is utility patented. It's manufactured in the United States in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Currently we are pre revenue, but by the time Sigma Blocks is filmed this summer, I expect that we will be roughly 3 to $400,000 in revenue on our commercial EV charging unit. As far as awards goes, we have received grants through the Department of Energy and Sandia National Labs and we had our technology validated through capstone programs through the three New Mexico PhD universities. We were on season 17 of the Blocks. Hello. We were also one most investable in that season. As far as our company, we have three partners and four very active advisors. So not just your monthly advisors, these are day to day meetings, calls and actually boots on the ground getting some work done. As far as funding, we are just now approaching about $300,000 in friends and family fundraising and that's on top of close to $400,000 of partner and advisor money that has already been invested. The great thing about SANU is we have zero debt. All of the money that we have raised to this point and for the foreseeable future is going into continuing to develop our technology.",
      "Answer 3": "So I already mentioned that I am the CEO and partner of sanu. Additionally, I am a partner in a research and strategy consultancy, which has given me a lot of the important tools to help advance this entrepreneurial endeavor that we're in the middle of. So I've used those skills throughout my life and a lot of other things. And one of those things is actually music. I'm a performing musician. I also produce live events for other touring musicians, and it was through those musical connections that I actually came to SANU as a partner. So music has been a huge part of my life as a sort of a hobby, but also as something that has been a funnel for my business career. When I'm not working on SANU or performing, I'm on the advisory board for my regional food bank, helping them from a PR and marketing perspective of advancing that mission. In my free time, I love to spend time with my friends, my family, of course, my girlfriend Jamie, and our dog, Hazel. We spend a lot of time on the water, on our boat, looking for whales and sharks and all sorts of other sea life. We are really passionate about the ocean, giving back, cleaning the oceans. We go on every morning. We do a beach walk and we clean the beach. So we're passionate about that. Anyway, excited about Sigma Blocks. Hope I make it. Love the blocks. Thanks for having me."

With $4M in venture backing, they've been able to generate $1M in rev in the past year in the health industry space and have been awarded multiple Phase 1 SBIR's from DoD.  They're using their technology right now to keep the companies that are manufacturing DNA and RNA for the purposes of R&D and security compliant while they are doing so.  They feel that their major differentiator is the AI platform they've built to help keep these companies compliant, streamline communication across all divisions, and help everyone in the process regardless of their level of biology expertise understand how to process the data.  Their DoD use case is to utilize their \"off the shelf\" platform and tech to conduct bio surveillance using UAS and gather samples using the same technology.  Admittedly, I don't know much about the bio space in defense, but the traction and iteration speeds along with their gov readiness level is compelling me to recommend them for an invite to put them on your radar if you feel they'll be valuable to the accelerator.

      "Answer 1": "Area Security is a small business and non traditional defense contractor. When I think about indopacom, there's some significant challenges. You have the tyranny of distance. You also have a new challenge with respect to fixed sites that are no longer effective in providing defense against adversaries. The dispersion of capability is critically important. With the dispersion of capabilities, security becomes a huge challenge for the mission. A mission that is needs to be accomplished by a smaller group of security personnel that are deployed to support the mission. And this really drives the need for autonomy. So when you think about the advantage of a force multiplier of autonomy throughout Indo Pacific, there's some things that become super critical. The ability to plan missions, the ability to train for missions, and then the ability to execute those missions which are increasingly complex because the autonomous capability, but has to be supported through a leaner staff of operations. And this is where the area security technology makes all the difference. We reduce the complexity of planning through a very sophisticated modeling, simulation and AI capability. And then in the field we support a one to many capability of running autonomous ground systems as well as aerial systems to really be a force multiplier during those critical hours or critical days of deployment in order to accomplish a particular mission. This technology has been through a phase two SBA process predominantly in the Air Force as a part of their contingency response mission, and has been proven to be a significant force multiple supplier to those operations as demonstrated through exercises in.",
      "Answer 2": "Area Security is a small, non traditional business. We have about 70 employees. We've been in business for about two decades. The start of our business was really DTRA reaching out to us and asking us to develop a capability that could be used by subject matter experts, not PhDs, in order to assess the vulnerabilities of our nuclear stockpile weapons. We built that software for them. It was called Avert Physical Security and they use it today to support their operations. It has been through the rigor of a DOD VVNA which is very significant, one of the few pieces of software of this nature that has gone through that discipline. And it's that core piece of software that enables us to expand into the C2 capability and orchestration of autonomous systems into in the field. This has been demonstrated through numerous Phase 2 SBIRS and we have been very engaged in the Air Force, particularly with the CRG and USAFI in order to extend their lean operations and give them a real force multiplier in the field as they support LSA type of operations in the USAFI mission area. And this has been proven through both aerial and ground based autonomous systems from a single operator in the talk orchestrating those operations.",
      "Answer 3": "Aries is a small business. We have a CAGE code. We have UEI code. We have done previous work through the Cibber process. We've also been contracted through OTAs as well as program of record. For example with DTRA, we do have security clearances as a facility clearance as well as we have individuals within the company that exercise top secret clearances. We've also done work with DOE and that is at a classified level as well."

      "Answer 1": "Rexata Solutions solves a big problem for small businesses and startups that are trying to figure out how to get funding, mostly through their contract structure. So what we help with is creative contracting strategies looking at federal, local, state and international opportunities, while also helping prepare them to have successful contracts and negotiate in the way to protect their intellectual property in their best interest for growth, or if they're planning to exit, to make sure that they sell with the appropriate intellectual property that they're looking for.",
      "Answer 2": "Rexata Solutions was founded by me, Dr. Dolores Cicciano Musina. We have been around for about four years. In the three years that we've been operating with full revenue, we have doubled revenue every single year. In terms of any kind of intellectual property, we have trademarked some of our brandings, such as Dynacorn and the term Rexata, which is an acronym but also helps capture our brand. In terms of awards, I have won a lot of awards, such as grants. I've also won prestigious awards like NCMA Fellowship and we have really worked very hard to be self funded. We don't have any venture capital behind us. It is all based on our work. We have grown to three employees over the last three years and we continue to strive to serve our clients and continue doing research and continuing being a boutique firm.",
      "Answer 3": "We are registered in SAM mostly to support some of the research projects that we have been doing in combination with some universities. However, we do not plan to hold any government contracts and do not currently hold any government contracts. The intent of Rexata is to really help industry and help them in figuring out their contract strategy. Our academic work and our research is really where we partner with a lot of universities to help government clients, whether it's training or whether it's doing research for leveraging contract pathways, authorities and statutes that are appropriate for the work that that government agency is doing. So we are ready to work with the government. However, it is not part of our business plans directly to be a prime with the government. Our intention is to always to be a value added partner."

      "Answer 1": "Hi, I'm David Willard Goodbymud and I'm with Nooks. NUX exists to solve classified infrastructure and make it available to industry, both non traditionals and startups as well as traditional and government, to make a problem and pain point go away. It is a dumb problem that we all have. We all share the pain. There's not enough classified infrastructure. What is there isn't confused in a way that supports distributed work, the varieties of different use cases inside of those facilities and it slows down and hinders everyone. So what Nooks does is we have taken taken a an attempt with our venture to engage with industry as a partner to sponsor locations across the country, to build out a network of sites where work can be done by any number of properly cleared, properly sponsored individuals and companies. But to remove the barrier to entry that you need to have both an FCL that is possessive as well as the time and money and sponsorship to build out a space of your own and then more importantly to get the networks installed. So what we're doing is taking the complete capability of a SCIF ready to go, including networks and network access, using our timelines, our capital to build that space and then sharing it fractionally so that people pay for this usage they need, when and where they need it. We also have solution space around services for companies that don't want to learn or don't know how to spell an FCL or DD254. How can we help them through that entire process? How abstract away the pain of learning this obscure bureaucratic process? Classified labs, classified manufacturing and then mobile SCIFs. How do we make this infrastructure simple and available when and where you need it?",
      "Answer 2": "Yes Nooks. We have closed our Series A which included equity and debt instrument that's given us the ability to hire additional staff, fully build out all three of our first sites. El Segundo National Landing, Colorado Springs. We have about 160,000 square feet of ICD705 and supporting space that is coming on the market this year. Some of it is already a market Colorado Springs and that equity also included a debt component which we can use for some of the capital costs associated with getting the spaces up, running networks installed, etc. We also have several contracts with government to include sponsorship for multi year accreditation support and the commercial business. We have several large traditional contractors as well as a number of kind of defense tech firms, venture capital, venture backed defense tech firms that are customers of ours both on the services side. So this is kind of the assistant FSO as a service and support getting through the wickets of getting your FCL as well as managing your personnel and your program securities as well as kind of our opening phase in Colorado Springs. Those customers are there. We have about 22 employees with a growth plan to 50 later this year.",
      "Answer 3": "I would say NOOKS is very government ready. We are actually in the process of transitioning to a phase three contract. We actually have one phase three contract already, but we're transitioning to kind of an enterprise contract through GSA which will be available to DoD wide and it abstracts away some of the policy challenges government has for accessing this infrastructure ourselves. The other thing it does, it provides a much longer tail for kind of accreditation, sponsorship and support for the work we've already started under our original CBIR SBIR Phase 2 and then our follow on Stratfi which is a strategic funding increase with the Air Force. So we work with government. We already have our fco, we have our sponsorship, we have CAGE codes built out three sites as we mentioned, with about five to six more in the works for this year, signing this year in the next next few months and then delivering those sometime in 2026. Government we have multiple government sponsors including an enterprise service customer who is a sponsor for the GSA work and a number of engagements at very senior leader levelship in Congress, in the White House and in OSD as well as kind of at the PEO and.",

Since those can be very hard to break into, anyone going after logistics and ecom will be slow to get data while this company found a beachhead that gets them data and proof much faster and will be ready for gov long before those going after logistics and ecom as their dual use case.

And we do that by delivering innovative remote sensing capabilities to our war fighters that they can execute on national security missions. Fundamentally, we believe that bad people do less bad things if they know they're going to get caught. That's deterrence. That's the mission we're committed to supporting. We do that by delivering best in class technologies for exploiting remotely sensed data, especially in time dominant mission areas to rapidly detect, track, and ultimately provide the information necessarily to interdict threats to our warfighters, our allies and our nation.",

We've grown more than 30% year over year and are approaching 500 employees. As an organization we've achieved this growth by delivering transformative solutions for critical war fighting problems and in particular delivering the future operationally resilient ground evolution. For the National Missile Warning enterprise we deliver the ground solution which is the basis for the nation's missile warning, missile defense and battlespace awareness capabilities. We've shown that we can take a legacy program that took 20 years to deliver an initial capability and in less than three years completely replace the legacy capability with a fully modernized open architecture system. Do it at a price point which makes sense. Do it on time and do it on budget. This is the biggest example of our success with the government and national security programs. However we have a variety of similar examples of success with Space Force, Missile Defense Agency, Air Force, Navy and others.",

Right now they are working with maritime companies on the project and have some private projects with the NAVY in San Diego as well as UCF.  Both are funding their goal of this being shelf ready for defense by Q 2 or 3 of this year.  They've been assesses as a TRL ready 4.  They have CAGE code and UEI, as well.  Right now the application is being used for Blue to Blue only.  They need most help in the cyber security of the application and navigating opportunity for defense contracts.

They also have a patent on the tech.",
      "Answer 1": "Hi, guys. My venture for Relay Nexus is we're trying. We're solving the problem of lack of GPS and WI fi underwater. So we are working on connecting underwater companies, mostly in defense, for communications and navigation, which is a major problem when it comes to submarines and maritime vessels communicating with one another. Another thing is stealth. How do we keep that stealth component? Normally, with sonar and acoustics, you have a way of tracking. If you're using laser optics in the water, you do not.",

So we have brought in about 200,000 from our family and friends round. For our revenue model. We're looking on selling the hardware component to transmit a laser bi directionally back and forth from another mesh buoy. We're also looking at a possible SAS model that'll be per year to establish that connection. The patent that we are we have rights to currently is with the San Diego Naval Department and it is a patent that establishes acoustic connectivity with the use of optics for underwater communications. And we currently have three years on awarded for research with use of this patent. It expires in 2030and we are looking to do an exclusive deal after the three year mark of feasibility testing in the ocean. We are a total of three employees at the moment and that's who we are.",
      "Answer 3": "Hi guys. So at the moment we're still establishing a cage code registering the company out of the state of Wyoming. That's our goal. We are currently the TRL level for this technology is a TRL4 acronym stands for Technology Ready Level, which is used in defense. This technology is currently at a level four. Our goal is to bring it to a level six for this year with extended feasibility testing and strengthening the signal at 100 meters. We've currently tested at 12 meters working with the University of Central Florida successfully and our goal is to get to 100 meters in order to begin ocean testing. We don't require security clearance. This is an unclassified patent use. There's no clearance required at this time. In our research in our contract vehicles, we're working with the Naval Air Warfare center out of San Diego to establish them as our first customer. They have agreed to test the technology as a first customer in the first phase."

No answer on either numbers.\n\n1/30/29 - Rescheduled call for 2/1/25 @ 1400 EST\n\n2/1/25 - Splashone is building a fighter drone that will be capable of firing 9mm rounds in the air to combat enemy drone strikes or hacking.  Jeff, the CEO, a transitioning service member, referred to it as the \"anti- drone drone\" venture.  He stated the problem with combatting drone strikes or hacking is usually remedied by trying to jam or spoof the opposing drones, but that isn't always effective, so they are building a drone capable of firing the 9mm rounds rather than missiles to lighten the payload and be more effective in this effort.  The venture is in early prototype phase without a full proof of concept, but has strong leadership and the right connections to bring this technology to gov ready.  It's an early bet, but they are doing something almost no other UAS company we have spoken to is doing.  The venture is bootstrapped right now, awaiting proof of concept to get a round of funding and be in a position for SBIR grants which Jeff's team has key people in place to secure.  The venture has a good \"Dual Use\" case in agriculture being able to use the technology to what's called \"pig bombs\" in some of the country's areas where this is a problem.  What the venture lacks in traction today, they more than make up for by having the right team in place.  They're a very early stage startup with key members of DoD, transitioning service members, and intelligence in all the right areas to get their traction.  The CEO spoke of potential opportunities they have with the White House which could further their inside knowledge of where and how they need to bring the venture to the stage of TRL ready for the Warfighter.  I believe that had they been working  on this venture longer than 4-5 months, their traction would be a in a very different place, and while I'd like to see more traction for a sure fire recommendation for an invite, the tech and leadership is impressive enough for me to recommend an invite.  ",
      "Answer 1": "SplashOne Robotics is making the world's first fighter drones. These are necessary because all of the counter drone systems that are on the market today are limited by physics. They are either ground based and thus expensive, hard to defend, and they have to be large and bulky and thus not maneuverable and thus vulnerable to other types of enemy fires. Or the ones that are in the air are sacrificial interceptors. Anduril's Roadrunner, for example, costs a quarter of a million dollars. A rim 116, it's a little bit more than that. And so we're talking about using a nice down payment on a house to take out something that's the cost of 2, $3,000 worth of hardware that the Houthis can send at us. Today we have nothing. But Splash One's going to build the fighter drones that can take out enemy drones for the cost of a beer or maybe a hamburger per shot. And not only to do it once, but to have one versus many victories where we can send a single aircraft into the overhead, engage a swarm of enemy drones with individual shots, come back, reload and do it again. So we can dominate incoming swarms with smaller numbers of reusable, low cost technology.",
      "Answer 2": "We are almost exclusively in the defense business. This means that it is a kind of feast or famine. You've even made it to the point where you can be a program of record and you're making the serious returns or you're not there yet. And even on the the middle ground where you're getting some siber traction, you're getting some sort of demonstration traction, there's not a lot of revenue. You're mostly operating on capital. And that's the point we're at right now. We are executing the first stages of our Family, Friends and early angels fundraising round, our pre seed round and the objective for this one for the next six to nine months, all we're trying to do is to get the money required to file for the patents that we're going to need. Things like on our demonstration platform here on the wings, a sensing device to determine where roughly the aircraft are that we're going to hunt down using polyspectral initial detection under the belly, a gun pod using common off the shelf calibers with bullets that are our proprietary design and ballistics that are our design as well. But short range kills compared with the many kilometers of kills that other people are trying to do from the ground right now. Behavioral aspects are going to be patents as well. To do this, we're going to need to hire some of the world's best engineers in the Autonomy space. And we think we can get top talent not only with dollars, but with the opportunity to work on robots that shoot each other down. We can probably get some pretty exciting people to be equally passionate about the project with us as we go along.",
      "Answer 3": "So I'm going to go in two different directions with government ready. One, are the external trappings of things that are provable and measurable, like do we have a cage code, do we have a contract vehicle, do we have a UEI number, clearances, etc. The only thing we have on that is security clearances for us as individuals, but not as a corporate entity. We don't have a facility. As you can see, I'm literally building stuff in my garage at this point while I'm leaving active duty. But here's what we have that almost nobody else has is we have the, the deep connections to the people who have the checkbooks, who write the programs, and who are the arbiters of where these things are going. Because right now it's us. We're leaving active duty because we know what needs to come next and we can't do it in uniform. So we're building a company to do the things that we think are necessary for the next step in the robotic revolution. We're coming into this with a fresh Rolodex, with fresh relationships built with our peers who are making these decisions, so we know exactly how the dollars flow, what office they come from, and have personal backstories and history with the people who are making these decisions right now.",

      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/5/25 - Booked call for 1/7/25 @ 1300 EST\n\n1/7/25 - Ray's company Evo-Lux is like an UBER for helicopters.  Their commerical viability has been pairing users to operators for helicopter charters and operators to areas needed for disaster relief.  They've been using that to fund R&D for their defense tech which mostly valuable in the software and AI used to communicate with helicopters, aircrafts, and drones for mission take off and landing, emergency landing, assessing the aircrafts resource level and what's needed in the area, and putting all of that into a universal technology system avoiding communication between multiple sites and keeping stealth.  While most of their traction is in the commercial space, I think the tech for mission planning, evaluation, and communicating is more valuable for defense than using it to pair operators with users.  It could be used to pair active/inactive drones with the needs in the area, and all landing/take off sites to execute missions with stealth communication on a universal software platform.  They have a team of software developers, many of which are US based.  They have a CAGE code and a contract vehicle, but no current security clearance.  "

Their software analyzes the effectiveness of their cognitive and mental health to get ahead of this problem before it occurs.  The company has been doing this in private sector for some time, but given the problem they identified, they'd like to bring their dual use case to DoD for this.\n\nThey're a bit early on with any gov traction but have made many strides at the enterprise level, and they bring all their enterprise data to solve this problem for DoD.\n\nThey're a bit green, but there's also no one really in this space that we have already.\n\nThe company is bootstrapped but generating rev and working with a small team of harvard psychological experts, tech experts, and software engineers.\n\nThere's a lot they can bring to the table with the problems they've identified if they can make traction through the proper channels.

      "Answer 1": "I'm the co founder of Contextuality. We use AI and language analysis to measure a series of psychological variables so that we can uncover a person's cognitive and emotional state. The US Military faces a significant financial and manpower challenge in recruiting and retaining personnel. In the army alone, 20 to 30% of new recruits leave before completing their first term. Each recruit who separates prematurely represents 50 to 75,000 in wasted recruiting efforts. Research shows that psychological factors like stress, coping, emotional stability, resilience are critical in determining who thrives under pressure and succeeds in the military. At the heart of our work is this notion that a person's spoken language contains a lot more information about them than they would self report. So when people are struggling, self report measures often fall short of capturing what might actually be going on for them. This is often because of social desirability bias, because they want to sound a certain way or they may not be able to articulate what's really going on for them. Our core technology is an AI based interviewer that puts an individual in a simulated environment to get the right psychological markers that will give information about their state of mind. Our work so far with individuals and with coaching and therapy clients has shown us that this type of psychological information can lead to meaningful change and timely interventions for those who are struggling. Now, when you apply this to a high stress environment like national defense, and to those who are responsible for protecting our country, this work becomes hundred x more impactful because this data can be used to provide targeted and timely interventions to cadets in the areas they're struggling in, leading to better team cohesion, increased resilience and a successful candidacy.",
      "Answer 2": "So Contextuality is an early stage startup for very new the core technology draws upon the work we've done at my other company, which focuses on the consumer space. We've done this type of psychological assessment for hundreds of people, coaches, therapists. The work we have done there has enabled us to fine tune our models to detect a host of psychological variables that would be more appropriate. And in the defense context, we are a small but mighty team. We are 100% bootstrapped and we bring domain expertise in technology, AI and psychology, and decades of industry experience as well. My background personally is in technology, data analytics and in psychology. I've spent most of my career working in tech, working in startups and large enterprises, and I have a graduate degree in psychology from Harvard. My co founder is a seasoned technologist and business builder, having built multiple startups and taken several ventures within Fortune 500 companies from 0 to 1.",
      "Answer 3": "So we don't have security clearance yet, but we are registered with the SAM and we have a CAGE code. Having worked in the mental health space and having built for that space, we're pretty aware of the data and security compliance requirements. We've built HIPAA and SoC2 compliant products in the past and we're well versed in building highly secure infrastructure for products that collect sensitive information. Additionally, my co founder has worked extensively with the U.S. department of Transportation and is well versed in the process processes required to become contract ready."

Their technology has broad applications, ballistic explosive proof structures that can be errected quickly, including medevac solutions for military helicopters, collapsible drone wings, and even inflatable bridges capable of supporting tanks. They are currently self-funded with $1M invested and are actively working with Air Force Task Force 99 on various projects. Their small but capable team consists of four employees, with additional contractor support, and is focused on refining prototypes and exploring military use cases.\n\n\nWhile they have no current government contracts, they have applied for multiple patents and were selected by the Air Force for a showcase. Their technology is at TRL-5/6 and not yet off-the-shelf ready but can be adapted within weeks to meet specific needs. They are registered on SAM.gov, have a CAGE Code, and are seeking opportunities to engage directly with warfighters to refine their solutions. Given their innovative technology, military applicability, and potential for rapid iteration, I recommend they be considered as an alternate because of the multiple uses of their technology.",
      "Answer 1": "At Dematerial, we create ultra lightweight, highly packable, yet extremely strong, low cost, rigidly inflatable combat systems, what we call RICs that meet or exceed the current requirements for many critical products used throughout the DoD and allow for the creation of new products not yet offered that will help protect and support our warfighters. This includes our ultra lightweight, highly packable unmanned aerial systems or other unmanned vehicles. This also could include medvac solution that can convert a Blackhawk or other both vehicles, ground vehicles or air vehicles that need to be converted into a medvac solution in under five minutes. We also can create solutions like a kinetic and or shrapnel protective shield or shelter that can protect against drone attacks. Now, the main problem that we are solving that these products offer is that they are extremely lightweight, they're highly packable during transportation, yet they're extremely strong and durable when they get to the battlefield. And this is extremely important because logistics win wars. And that's what our RICS devices are trying to solve, is to get the war fighters solutions that ultimately will be easy to transport and yet very highly effective. And when it comes to the unmanned aerial vehicles, the lightweight and packability is extremely valuable when you're talking about mass and tens of thousands of units flying. And so these are some of the solutions we're offering at Dematerial to help the Department of Defense and our war fighters.",
      "Answer 2": "Material is a self funded company. I've invested over a million dollars in this company, will continue to support it long into the future until we succeed. We have applied for one patent and working on another application currently and we'll get multiple awards from each of those applications. We've had some success and interest within the DoD over the last two years, including the US Air Force Task Force 99 which showed significant interest in our inflatable wing UAV that we are working on developing, although that is a longer term project. And there is interest from Colonel Samuel L. Fricks which is Chief of Army Future Commands Medical Evacuation Concepts and Capabilities Division. And we're working towards a medvac focused prototype of our rigidly inflatable combat systems for a innovation day for the Medical Capabilities Development Integration Directorate. We believe that there's a lot of progress that we'll be making in the next few months, including prototypes and hopefully even some contracts within the next months or this year.",

They have an MVP developed and are testing it in gov agencies, but did not mention which ones or which applications.  They are bootstrapping funding right now and have basic gov readiness with UEI and CAGE code.  Extending an invite to learn more about the agencies they are testing with and the results of the testing.  ",
      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/20/25 - Booked call for 1/22/25 @ 1200 EST\n\n1/22/25 - Cyber security company at MVP stage with a decent amount of traction as far as defense tech goes.  They specialize in mitigating AI threats not only to the data networks they work in but any hardware working off of the cloud such as autonomous vehicles and mobile communication.  Most of their traction is working with private sectors in other countries such as Nigeria and the U.K. where they've been successfully testing their tech and iterating it for the user's needs.  The category where they have the least amount of traction is gov readiness.  The venture wanted to get their product in the hands of the user as fast as possible and saw that opportunity working with public and private companies i the U.K. and Nigeria.  They've acknowledged their short comings in gov readiness and are seeking out this program for mentorship on how to apply their ready tech to U.S. gov contractors.  They have a solid team in place, UEI, number, and CAGE code, and are relying on us to help further their gov readiness mentorship.  They've also been applying to SBIR grants while they search for mentorship.  It's worth mentioning that I don't think they should get a straight bid into SigmaBlox, but I firmly believe they are a solid alternate and did not want to DQ them incase we need additional companies at a later stage.  Because of the traction theyve made over seas and their basic gov ready level, I think they'd be a good fit if needed.  ",
      "Answer 1": "Hello, I'm Kanayo Ogun and I'm the co founder and the CEO of Flagged. Flagged Inc. Has built a very robust cloud security software as a service platform leveraging on advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to Flag, identify, detect, mitigate and remediate AI driven phishing, business email compromise and social engineering scams perpetrated by foreign hostile governments or state actors using AI driven tools. Why is this a big problem? The problem has compounded now because having access to AI on a wide scale has given state actors and hackers and cyber criminals an easy pathway to perpetrate crimes with ease, with skill and at a ratio that has never been seen before. Now it's very easy for AI driven crimes or attacks on critical infrastructure to slip through the cracks. Because AI by its own very nature can be very robust, can be very complicated and can be very difficult to decipher. So the manual existing systems we have in place cannot protect the government and its people and Americans from AI driven attacks perpetrated in foreign countries skilled with the art of AI tools. That's where Flag comes in. So we have built a very robust layer or platform that can identify, that can mitigate, remediate and protect US critical infrastructure and the people in America and its allies as well. And that's exactly what Flag does in real time. We can spot and identify these attacks as they happen and then we can mitigate them using our robust technology. Thank you very much.",
      "Answer 2": "Well flagged is currently pre revenue so we are a pre revenue startup but we have an MVP and the MVP has been built to be as robust as possible while still being lean at the same time and the plan here is to put this MVP in the hands of real users and then get feedback and iterate upon that feedback which we have started doing. We've put the MVP in the hands of a few users some of them government agencies and others private enterprises and other skilled individuals out there and we are really getting positive feedback and we are iterating on the feedback and improving the MVP working towards building the version one that will be out any moment from now. So that's where we are and it's just a pre revenue startup with an MVP that is currently being bootstrapped. That's where we stand. We are in the pilot stage at the moment and we're looking forward to working with you guys so we can blow this up together. Thank you.",
      "Answer 3": "Yes. So far, Flagged has registered the company on the SAM.gov website on the government portal. And of course, we have a UEI number. I believe we have a CAGE code. We have done all those and we've started collaborating and communicating with cisa. So we've done our own best within this time frame that we have here, operating from Austin, Texas. So we've done that. We've gotten that covered. However, we will need resources, we will need mentorship and your expertise to be able to go to the next level by getting connected and having access to, having government contracts and where we can be in a better position to use our solution to protect the U.S. critical infrastructure, the U.S. government, the people within the U.S. and of course, its allies. So that's where we need you guys to come in. But on our own, we have already taken the first step of making sure that we are registered with SAM Gov, we have the UIE number, et cetera. So that's where we are. So we are kind of ready to start working with the government. We just need that little bit of mentorship and guidance on how to go about the next steps. Thank you."

This innovation allows quantum computing to be deployed in the field rather than solely in the cloud.\n\nTheir main challenge is scaling production. They are funded through SBIR grants for $5M and a $4.5M seed round backed by Tim Draper, Costla, and Alpha Edison, with $5M in government funding from NASA, the Air Force, and SolCom.\n\nA hand-built prototype will be ready for testing in 18-24 months, with mass production possible in three years. Their key advantage is achieving quantum computing at room temperature with minimal power requirements.",
      "Answer 1": "Coherent is developing room temperature quantum computing technology that will enable quantum computing to be deployed at the edge. Conventional computers have certain limitations that quantum computing overcomes. We've seen this with cloud based systems that are capable of solving very complex problems in much shorter periods of time than can be achieved with conventional computing. But these systems that exist in the cloud need to be super cooled. IBM, Google they are running superconducting transmon type qubits those are operated at temperatures below 1 Kelvin. Even trapped ion systems need technically very cold atoms in order to perform their computation. They just immobilize them with lasers. Coherent is using technology that is compatible with silicon fabrication. Our quantum bits are deployed on silicon wafers. They operate at room temperature. We take advantage of topologically protected states that have energy gaps above 25 MeV and therefore we can access them at room temperature and perform computation and circuit development that allows us to deploy on forward deployed systems and in edge scenarios.",
      "Answer 2": "The initial material technology behind our quantum computing platform was funded by grants from NASA, and we have been supported by RD grants from the Air Force Research Lab, the Air Force's 96 Test Wing, and the Special Operations Command. In addition, we have raised an initial round of more than $4 million from investors including Morpheus Ventures, Draper Associates, Khosla Ventures, and Alpha Edison. This has enabled us to move our technology forward and develop improved circuits and improved resonators and reduce our noise in our circuits and enable room temperature operation. Additional traction in the form of patents. We have multiple patents already issued and a number of patents that have been applied for both in the US and internationally. This will enable us to make, use and sell both in the US and around the world.",
      "Answer 3": "Coherent has all of the necessary certifications and registrations to accept government contracts. We have a UEI number. We have a CAGE code. We have had SBIR contracts as well that could be used as a sole source justification for future contracts."

They've patented technology to clean ethanol from corn and seaweed to be used to make a more cost effective fuel source for DoD applications like jets, helicopters, drones, and more.  Their efforts were used to get this fuel to sites overseas where our troops are.  Henry worked for Palantir before starting his own venture, and th company is funded with 620k right now at the R&D stage which up to 3 million through SBIR in it's final stages to be awarded.  They've got some commercial traction working with other companies that are doing similar things for commercial jets and the department of energy for their dual use case.  They have UEI, Cage Code, TS Clearance and are at a TRL 5.  Recommending for invite.  He also came referred to us from Cat Orman who has already been admitted to SigmaBlox.",
      "Answer 1": "Everybody, my name is Henry Markarian. I'm the CEO and co founder of Integrated Dynamics. Pitch is simple. Virtually everything in the United States and abroad comes from oil or is connected to oil in some way. All the way from my phone to the shirt off my back, to the wax on the lunch that I had earlier. Virtually all of it is interconnected with oil. It's a tremendous economic boom for our nation and allows us to ensure that we can project force either through directly peaceful means of economic superiority or also more confrontational means through powering our equipment and our soldiers abroad. For a period of time. I actually worked on battery technology. We're trying to replace large generators and working with 91 delta generator technicians. So I know how pervasive it is. And I say pervasive because it's not a. It's not a great thing. We've seen the side effect of fresh fracking, of drilling, how it affects our nation and its citizenry. It's a necessary evil. But there are ways around it. The ethanol industry has figured out a way to turn byproducts from farming, something that we do innately just to have food on the table, into a substantial source of fuel. But this model hasn't been applied elsewhere simply because the feedstock is too expensive and ethanol can only be used on so many things. What we're doing at Integrated Dynamics is leveraging high temperature, so above 85 degrees Celsius, synthetic microbes to allow us to, one, access lower cost feedstocks instead of, say, cornstarch and sugars, we can access bagasse and corn stover and wood chips and sawdust and things like this, so that we can have wider unsubsidized margins on products all across the commodity value chain. From gases that would come into the production of sustainable aviation fuel like hydrogen and carbon dioxide, to drop in fuels like butanol and ethanol, all the way to specialty chemicals like isopropanol and acetone.",
      "Answer 2": "So we're a pretty early stage company. I'd say about two years in actually two years and I think two weeks now. But we have quite a bit of traction thus far. We're already working with some DoD affiliated companies. I can't speak totally about it because it's a lot of CUI controlled unclassified information in this case. But we have worked with a wide array of commercial partners to both show them our capabilities on cellulose degradation. So being able to use their feedstocks at their would already produce and also interacted with people across the SAF space, the renewable fuel space as an extension, the agrochemical and regular chemical space to show them that what we're doing in our lab is directly applicable to lower and commodity chemical prices. We don't have revenue yet, but we're looking to achieve revenue through this year through paid studies, essentially going up to certain agrochemical or byproduct companies and saying let's take your waste and turn it into some sort of fuel or chemical. In terms of patents, we are in the pre patent pipeline. So we've filed a provisional patent. We're continuing to file them to cover our synthetic biology, but more so our platform as a whole of high temperature fermentation. We have five employees. We're actually a part of the Hiring our Heroes program. So one of which is a Hiring our Heroes fellow. And we have raised $620,000 of dilutive funding to date with $50,000 from Energy Works and in the form of an in kind project with eco engineers to develop an LCA for our technology.",
      "Answer 3": "So in terms of government readiness, I'm just going to read all of these questions here. First things first. Actually, myself and my co founders have a background in government contracting. I worked for Palantir for a bit. Before that, I worked for a company called Natreon. So I've been writing Sibbers for a while. At this point, I had an interim Top Secret clearance. My co founder, Jake, has tssci. We have a UEI number and a cage code. No contract vehicle yet. We're a little early for that. But the biggest thing for us to stress is that we're familiar with the ecosystem. We've spent a lot of time, specifically at past startups and at this startup, talking to service members, talking about how what we do directly impacts the war fighter. And I've done this across multiple technologies. So my skills at this point are generalizable. My co founder, Jake Swede, spent five years in the US Army, a substantial portion of which deployed to the front lines. So he, you know, in parallel to me, understanding a little bit of the contracting side, he has the experience of an actual war fighter."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "Booked call for 3/27 @ 1300 EST\n\nThe venture has created a patent pending cloud capabilities solution specifically aimed at hive and drone swarming in areas where cloud computing isn't always available.  They work outside of typical cloud solutions like AWS to ensure what they're doing is unique.  The capabilities are focussed on mission planning and mission execution for drone swarms so that it doesn't rely on a relay system from one drone to another but rather a true hive mentality of all nodes in the swarms being all knowing of the other nodes.  The company is working off of an 800k angel funding round with 3-5 employees currently and has generated alot of interest with current prime contractors so far to work as a subcontractor.\n\nThat being said, they are VERY early on in this process.  They lack the traction and readiness for them to be a resounding \"YES\", but given what they've accomplished in a short time and the unique strategy they bring forward, they will make for an excellent collaborator ultimately bringing a solution to the warfighter whether directly or indirectly as a sub.\n",
      "Answer 1": "Hi, my name is Emma Bates. I used to work in the defense modernization industry and my job was to identify gaps between capabilities that strategists were expecting to rely on and the capability set that they actually had, and figure out what technologies were needed to fill those gaps. I started noticing that a lot of the technologies that they wanted and didn't have capabilities they wanted and didn't have, what stood between them was the cloud connection. Basically, they needed cloud capabilities. So consistency, resilience, redundancy, all of those good things that we love about using Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure to collaborate on documents instead of sending them back and forth by email, metaphorically speaking, they needed that common operating picture characteristic in places where they weren't able to access it. And they were thinking, well, once we get a better bandwidth connection, we can leverage AWS or Azure. My team and I come at that problem from a different perspective. We are creating the distributed system characteristics that enable you to have cloud in isolated and dangerous and denied environments without leveraging AWS or Azure. What that means is that you can have consistency and resiliency not just among clusters in a data center, but also among drones in the air, over wireless, in a forward operating base on a ship. We create cloud capabilities for environments that traditionally have not had access to them.",
      "Answer 2": "In terms of traction, we have been working towards a patent. It's pending, so we'll see on that. We have received a small amount of revenue.

We have about $800,000 in angel funding through Just a Safe Note. And yeah, we are still working on the sales process, especially since this is an innovative technology and enabling technology rather than a prepackaged product.",

We're able to pass a SOC 2 compliance, and in fact, our tech was designed and generally engineered by someone who is authorized to conduct PCI, DSS, and ISO 2-700-and-whatever tests like that on software. So we're prepared to pass those. We just haven't invested the money in paying someone outside to conduct the test. Let's see what else."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "The founders are working on a very early stage start up which is currently bootstrapped.  The venture focuses on using laser communications between satellites to relay any necessary communication in stealth.  They're working on a proprietary AI method which as they complete their thesis will increase the speed of how the communication is handled with less possibility of the com being intercepted.  For as early on as they are, their main focus for traction has been acquiring cloud credits for Amazon and Google to continue their R&D.  Their tech right now is only at a TRL 2, but they've been working on it a very short time and are trying to prove that the current methods being used could be exponentially better with AI methods.  This is a VERY early and VERY scrappy startup, but the founders behind it worked on the same type of technology for Microsoft which was widely implemented into BioTech and they believe will have more value to defense tech.  BioTech being their dual use case.  Recommending for an invite.  While very early stage, what they're doing sounds like it could be valuable and it's not overly saturated from others in SB.",
      "Answer 1": "Optical systems are a driving factor in all sorts of problems, ranging from your smartphone being able to take a picture, being able to do video calls, to satellites using optical and infrared systems to do sensing, to autonomous drones, to laser communications and to biomedical field. Our thesis is that AI is going to revolutionize here because it's able to explore design space so much faster than a human. Humans take heuristics for what worked, for instance, for red, green, blue, and apply it to infrared, apply it to these two very specific wavelengths to solve a problem. But. But an AI model is going to be able to search these areas much faster, and it's going to be a lot better at saying, have we fulfilled our particular objective function for an engineering problem compared to a subjective problem like art or literature? Our company is founded by myself and Alan Geller and optical system designer, so that we really incorporate both expertise in AI and expertise in the problem self itself. It's going to be, and we're going to be able to apply it as inputs for all these AI systems that are being developed, but they need sensor systems that capture the data that really solve the problem they're going for. So it's really a revolution. Narrator. Technique is coming both in terms of these designs and in terms of all of the systems enabled by these designs.",
      "Answer 2": "We're very much in the problem discovery phase phase because our goal is really to scale what my co founder Alan is doing by building a system that solves a bunch of these boutique problems but many of which are potentially very scalable in the defense and biomedical areas especially. Our main concern is building something that works and then applying it to particular problems in in these fields like laser communications, like pathogen identification identification. We have no employees other than Alan and myself and our main cost is cloud computer. So we're of course applying to programs to get that, to get that computational abilities. We've applied for black flag. Once we start gaining, once we start have designed a product that we think meets a need and have that validated with the customer, that's really when we'll be in a position to apply for longer term funding from VCs and such. So we're very much in the problem discovery phase, very much validating whether our techniques work.",
      "Answer 3": "We're in the initial phases of being government ready for our for our company. I started the company and established a C corp in order to apply for DARPA challenges and funding opportunities. I currently hold a Public Trust clearance, but I've previously held higher level clearances, with my most recent investigation being completed in 2021. So there are potentially opportunities there. But we do not have a UEI number, a CAGE code. We're not currently on a contract vehicle, so we're still very much looking for opportunities to insert ourselves into the government ecosystem. I have previously won challenges from the U.S. department of Navy, specifically Hack the Machine from Naval X, so I'm familiar with the process. I've previously been a government contractor, so very familiar with the process. But in terms of this particular company, we're still in the early stages of being government ready."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "2/3/25- Call booked for 2/10/25 at 11:00EST\n\n2/10/25- Kindo is an AI company that develops and deploys AI models with a focus on security and data management, offering customizable solutions built entirely by U.S.-based developers. Having raised $20.6M in Series A funding and $7M in seed funding, they are now looking to expand into the government sector. Their proprietary platform, developed from the ground up, sets them apart from competitors and would require significant investment to replicate. With 49 full-time employees and additional contractors, their resources are primarily focused on engineering. Kindo serves 20 enterprise clients, with 30 more in the pipeline, and maintains a cash-positive status. Their technology is partially off-the-shelf ready, requiring 3-4 months for a custom government project. While they are registered on SAM.gov and at TRL-6, they do not yet have a contract vehicle or CAGE Code. Given their strong technical foundation, government readiness, and potential for rapid adaptation, I recommend moving them to the next round.",

We have a law solution that's really enterprise ready. We have an entire platform dedicated to a very secure platform deployment of AI, whether it be self hosted in your data center or in our SaaS product in our space. So whichever and however you want to get to AI use for your industry into your enterprise, we're ready to help you.",
      "Answer 2": "So we're a series A company ready to raise a Series B ram. So we have a lot of traction, a lot of VCs who believe in us and who believe in leadership. Our CEO Ron, the founder, he's a three time exit from very large amazing ventures. He's been a size of three times. So he knows my problems every day. Our CTO Brian came out of Google and understands what it's like to ship a massive protocol the entire Google work suite. He was a guy who was the creator of a lot of that stuff and myself, I came out of having done the US Air Force forecast and run. I came out of the White House for doing the Presidential Innovation Fellowship and Department of Navy doing Black Pearl. So between the three of us, we understand what it's like to try to ship products out to very, very large massive customers. We also understand the prioritization of national security besides my time in the government. Ron, our CEO is former Air Force and there's a lot of folks within Kendo who's former service members and former intelligence. So we know what it means to serve that community in those communities. We also know precisely what it means to try to come up with software that war fighters, intelligence officers alike will love.",
      "Answer 3": "How government ready is your venture? I love this question. So I am the founding cloud architect of the Castle Run. One of the first things we did was shrink down the ATO cycle. I started to operate to this day average ATO times 18 to 24 months. We figured out how to get it done to one day. So my record is one day. In fact it's shorter. Black pearl for Department of Navy similarity with the continuous ATO pipe for that. So how ready for the government? Quite. I understand very clearly what it takes to not just to deploy government ready hardware software, but what it also means to deploy the high side and different kind of networking. And I think an additional step of the government readiness isn't whether or not you have something demoed as TR or whatever. It's having been the boots on the ground and use the software, having been the person who went forward to make sure everything works as expected or to interview the warfares to find out how they're using it versus how we envision using it. So I know full well what it means to be government ready, especially in the lens of shipping software to warfare intelligence officers.",

The venture builds \"lighter than air\" aircrafts specifically using vacuum lift cell instead of helium.  Their main objective is to collect better data at lower altitudes than helium aircrafts typically collect which helium aircrafts are better at collecting data at higher altitudes.  The company has raised about 800k to get through their R&D phase an requires at minimum another 4.5million in funding to take flight.  They've chosen the model of selling the data they collect instead of selling the aircraft itself to collect the data.  From what they're telling me, all signals they are receiving point to this being meaningful.  DARPA, Several VC's, DIU, and other branches told them they have a better way of collecting this lower altitude data with their vacuum lift cell, and once they take flight, they would be in line to buy, but getting this 4.5 million in funding is where they are stuck right now and no one has moved forward on getting that for them.  The TRL level is at about 4/5 with their team of 9 mostly focussed on engineering.  It sounds like it could be meaningful but it also sounds like they have a long way to go before it could be.  Recommending here for the sole purpose of just getting your eyes on it.  They've secured patents around this, but how meaningful is it to have a vacuum lift cell tech vs. helium tech for an aircraft?  "

      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/27/25 - Booked call for 1/29/25 @ 1030 EST\n\n1/29/25 - Starcycle is an early stage venture that has built an AI tool to help companies navigate their governance and compliance.  This was an interesting call because the tech is very ready but  they are in a beachhead strategy right now which could be applied very specifically to defense tech companies.  They got their proof of concept by using the AI tool for SMB's who wanted to dissolve their companies.  Essentially, they company would go through a \"setup wizard\" where they would answer questions about how their company was organized, it's shareholders, etc, then automatically check to make sure they had everything they needed, fill out, and file all of their forms for compliance.  They've been moving a bit into the tech industry by using the same methodology of AI governance and policy to ensure that the tech companies have all their proper registrations, and their tech is not infringing on anything illegal or putting the company in harms way.  This is a much FASTER and CHEAPER tool than hiring a lawyer for all of this.  They've been bringing on different lawyers and subject matter experts for a contract terms to help build the framework of the application and development, then once deployed they only need to retain them for minor adjustments.  They received 250k in angel funding then have been self sustaining by generating about 20k in rev per month.  I think this same tech could be very useful for defense tech companies that need their tech and hardware applications to be compliant to the gov and military standards.  An AI tool like this will help eliminate need for the ventures the military contracted to bringing on expensive lawyers and waste their resources to get the tech compliant.  The one downside to this applicant is they had little to no gov readiness because they've been working on their tech for commercial use.  We spoke about getting registered for UEI and CAGE Code immediately. Luke was passionate about talking about getting defense tech companies compliant, but wanted to make sure the tech was in place and they had the proper resources to begin applying this to defense tech.  Giving them a recommendation for invite because much of the companies already invited mentioned that their tech needs policy and governance solutions or will need it at some point in the near future.  At the very least, Starcylce would be a great alternate if you feel they're not ready yet.  ",

Our team is led by two co founders along with a founding engineer and interns in Development, Admin and UX UI Design. We've onboarded in house counsel from Fenwick, Gunderson and Cooley and we're conducting excuse me, we're contracting paralegals to ensure legal accuracy and compliance. We've geared up for our V2 of our self service platform launching in Q2 of 2025, aiming to increase our top of funnel further by 15 times per month. After closing a $250,000 angel round in Q3 of 2024, we're now planning our precede raise of 2 to $2.5 million. We are scaling fast and we are just getting started.",
      "Answer 3": "As an early stage company. We do not yet have security clearance, UEI number, cage code, or contract vehicle, but we are exploring the requirements for future government engagement. Applying to this accelerator is a key first step from a technology standpoint. Having spent eight years at IBM working under strict enterprise tech conditions, I'm confident our product can be deployed to meet any necessary security and compliance requirements. While I did not work directly on government contracts at IBM, I did undergo ITAR training and I have been exposed to the processes and considerations involved in working on such projects through my colleagues. Thank you."

      "Answer 1": "I'm Amy Wambaugh with Black Box Energy Systems. We have designed and patented a novel axial flux motor called the 2 volt multimodor. We say that we have better hardware, better software and better data that all is produced by this fabulous motor. It's ideal for directive and geared applications. It's very lightweight. The 5 horsepower NEMA 56 version weighs under 12 pounds including an integrated controller with VFD functionality. It has a programmable PLC so you can tell it what kind of motor to be and what to accept. It can accept 120 volt, it can accept 240. It can do single phase, three phase, split, split phase. Because it's super low profile. It's like the motor itself is like 2 inches deep and 6 inches wide for a 5 horsepower. When we add in the controls, it's less than 6 inches deep, same width. So it'd be great for drone applications. As a matter of fact, we have someone with an underwater drone that is asking for a custom size of this one. Because motors are a component, we're really good at figuring out how to integrate our technology into someone else's. This lightweight technology would be great for a portable generator. It's great for robotics and automation drones. It's just fabulous technology. It can get bigger or smaller and it's super efficient, which is great for a battery operated situation where you need it to be efficient at all loads, high loads and low loads. Anyway, I think it would be wonderful for the military to have this kind of technology available.",
      "Answer 2": "Black Box Energy Systems was recently accepted into the New York State Uptake alliance accelerator sponsored by New York Energy Research and Development Authority, or nyserda. We won a Navy SBIR for neemo, which is a little version of our motor, for an underwater drone application. We received a match grant for $100,000 from the state of Kentucky for that technology. We were voted a 2025 startup to watch by Louisville Business First. We have a full patent on the motor and international patents pending on that. We have just taken outside funding this year, $350,000 of non founder funding. Up to this point, we've been bootstrapping it. And then also the SBIR and the state matching grant and we do not have sales yet, but we have just begun selling and we have sales in the pipeline. In particular, we're getting ready to send a test motor for an underwater drone application for a company that we've been talking to for a little bit. So.",
      "Answer 3": "We are ready to work with the government. We have won a phase one SBIR for the Navy and we have the UEI code cage code. Our COO, Josh Rimmer, has spent 16 years and retired as Sergeant First Class from the Army. He held a US security clearance. Our founder, Dr. Elijah Jensen, has worked on numerous NASA and ISS projects with space based power electronics. We I'm trying to think what else we are able to produce in small volumes immediately our technology and could deliver it for government applications quickly. Obviously we need financing to grow, to deliver at scale."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "2/3/25- Call booked for 2/5/25 at 13:00EST\n\n2/5/25- US Based. The company is developing a counter-UAS (unmanned aerial system) detection and neutralization solution, focused on mid-market applications like airports and sports stadiums. Their technology offers a significantly more affordable detection system compared to traditional radar solutions, achieving a 100% detection rate compared to the typical 60-70% in the field. The system uses acoustics and has been tested with an autonomous air rifle for drone neutralization. They aim to expand by leveraging microphones across the country for drone detection. With $270k raised so far, the team is seeking a $2-3 million seed round to scale production and sales. They have a small but dedicated team, including full-time and part-time members, as well as students from UC Berkeley. Their software is focused on improving detection accuracy by filtering out ambient noise. Although they have not yet filed patents, they have secured $120k from Tech Stars and $150k from \"Do Not Pay\" via Joshua Browder. The technology is self-assessed at TRL-6 and they have a security clearance with the Federal Government of Canada. They are registered on SAM.gov but still need a CAGE Code. Given the solid progress on the product and team, and the potential for government application in the near future, I recommend moving forward with the venture, as it has good traction and significant promise.",
      "Answer 1": "Hi everyone, my name is Cameron Rowe. The venture that I am working on is called Hover and we build drone detection and counter drone solutions. So we're really focused on the full kill chain loop essentially. Originally we started off doing drone delivery and in that process we built a DAA model or a detect and avoid model. And what we realized when we were dealing with ship to shore drone delivery customers such as Norton Lilly's crew, if they own this massive ship, they were dealing with challenges associated with drone espionage from other companies. And so how we decided to approach this is layer in our computer vision solution for detection. However, what we realized is that the actual way superior technology that we had built is around acoustics and so even on board the drone with ambient noise, we were still able to detect other drones at 2km away. This is a passive drone solution. And when you're thinking about detecting drones, especially now that have onboard compute, Theseus is a big YC company that's now building this. Other companies in Russia are doing this, or even the fiber optic cables that we're now seeing take place across battlefields in Ukraine and against Israel by Hezbollah. All of these are issues that I really believe western militaries are going to have to face sooner or later. And I think it's important to be prepared. We, we can also input acoustics from cruise missiles, helicopters, planes, not just drones. But I think we're focusing on drones because we want to build our moat successfully in that sphere and kind of capitalize on some of the fear and demand that the market has for counter drone solutions, eventually then moving into kinetically disrupting it to have a full kill chain. But at least initially we're focused mainly on the detection and that's us. We have an awesome team based in Toronto and San Francisco. As you can see behind me, we're really excited about this opportunity.",
      "Answer 2": "Talking about traction, we have some great traction so far in our US entity. Although we're pre revenue, we were able to secure over $280,000 in funding. Of that, we have about 180,000 left. After pivoting from drone delivery, we had a successful drone delivery company up in Canada generating a couple hundred thousand dollars a year in revenue doing various drone deliveries. And as we kind of pivot that into the States, we realized that the counter drone solutions were much more in demand. Some of our team that has really been validating have come from Nvidia. As a research scientist helping us build the acoustics model, I myself am a drone engineer, but I've kind of leaned into the AI side of it, building out our moat through our acoustics model. That's really hard to replicate. I'm the one who builds and flies all our drones as well as we have some great people from Dedrone, which is one of the leading drone jamming and drone detection companies in the United States. And they're letting us know, hey, listen, D drone is only 60 to 75% effective at detecting some of these drones, whereas our solutions and testing have gotten to 100% affected. We actually haven't been able to fool the system other than by adding a ton of ambient noise, which eventually we're actually able to remove. And so the traction that I think is really exciting is when we talk to Ukrainians and they're saying, hey, we really want this. That's a massive market pull. That is the rationale behind us moving into this space.",
      "Answer 3": "So the stage that we're at is where our solution has been tested. One of the areas that I think is crucial to test it in is actually in a space where we're seeing a lot of drones, and this would be within Ukraine. We are currently in group chats with Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines in Russia in Kursk, who are telling us how much they want and need this. And so I think the way that we are approaching this is to test it as much as possible so that when we are starting to sell into government, we're able to indicate we've had a large degree of success testing this overseas in combat, so that the risk profile is decreased. I think although I'm a Canadian citizen, I should be able to get my.01 within the next couple weeks. We submitted everything already, so feeling very good about that. From a security clearance standpoint, I do have my top secret clearance with the RCMP in Canada. And so I believe this is going to make it a little bit easier to then lean into some of the states. We also have lots of US Team members who are able to facilitate a lot of these discussions. And I've been assured by our lawyers that this won't be an issue in actually selling into the government. So we're really excited. We think that this is a good opportunity, and I appreciate your time. Thanks so much."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/29/25- Call booked for 1/31/25 at 15:00EST\n\n1/31/25- The candidate is developing dual-use bifacial solar panels paired with a microgrid system, aimed at disrupting the fuel generator market. The technology is designed to be portable, withstand 120mph winds, and offers a unique dual-access tracking system. They have two utility patents for their technology, including a helical pile and a forthcoming patent for a folding and unfolding array. They are generating $1 million in revenue, with significant grants ($200K and $1.1M) from DOE Phase 1 and Phase 2. Their team consists of two full-time members and a few contractors, and they are focused on gearing up for the completion of the phase 1 of the DOE with an installation in Kansas. While the product isn't off-the-shelf ready for government use, they plan to build as needed and expect a development timeline of 16-18 months with proper funding.\n\nIn terms of government readiness, they are registered on SAM.gov with a CAGE Code, and they\u2019ve self-assessed their TRLs\u20146 for the microgrid and 8+ for the helical pile. They don\u2019t currently have an active government contract but are considering an OTA.\n\nGiven their traction, patents, and ongoing work with government-related funding, they have strong potential despite some gaps in immediate government readiness. Final recommendation: They would make a great alternative",
      "Answer 1": "Hello, I'm James Fikinion, CEO and founder of Helical Solar. And what we are doing is trying to disrupt the military and commercial fueled generator market. And we do that by combining the most efficient solar generation with a best in class hybrid micro grid. So what we have is a patented and patent pending articulating solar solutions. So probably the only solar solution that can fold or unfold itself that offers dual axis tracking in the marketplace. And we could generate about 35 kilowatt hours per day and about a 60 kilowatt hour per day maximum at its peak. And we could take that power and store it down into a 400 kilowatt hour battery lithium iron phosphate battery storage solution. And with really efficient inverters and chargers we can offer about a round trip, 94% efficiency at three phase commercial power for the warfighter. So what this does is we're trying to eliminate the 15 to $42 per gallon fuel cost in forward operating areas as well as the heat signature, noise signature and exhaust emissions, as well as, you know, the, the potential for war fighter casualties in those forward operating bases, bases during wartime, as well as logistics including convoys with trucks or bladderbird flights that also could come into to harm's way. And so we're really excited to share our solution with you guys and hope to hear back from you shortly.",
      "Answer 2": "Yes. So we are a true dual use company. On one side we have an agrivoltaics solution that we're currently working under USDA Climate Smart Commodity Subaward to deploy those inside cattle feeding pens at a large feedlot operator in Kansas. Originally, our company was funded by a US Department of Energy phase one and phase two starting in 2019, which led into that solar dual axis solar array development. Since then, back in 2024, we were invited to participate in an Air Force Wichita State Regional Collider event which led to a prototype demonstration with our Expeditionary Macro Grid featuring that same dual axis tracking solution at Tyndall Air Force Base. In June of 2024, we were we participated in the NSIN Expeditionary Energy Challenge hosted by the 15th SPSS and they were looking for a Space Domain awareness renewable energy platform that could power that. So to date we've raised 2.45 million in non dilutive grant funding and we have two employees currently.",
      "Answer 3": "Yes, so our Helical Solar is a government ready venture. We both employees have held security clearances in the past and should be able to get those renewed if they're inactive. Helical Solar itself has a an issued UEI number and an issued cage code. Currently we do not have any DoD or military contract vehicles per se, except that we are working under a USDA Climate Smart Commodities subaward at present. Since we did win or were selected as a finalist for the NSAN Expeditionary Challenge in the summer of 2024, it is possible that we could operate under an OTA or CRADA coming from that award through NSIN."

I'm not sure how applicable something like this would be to the warfighters, but I'd like to extend a call to learn more and the Gu$ decide should it get to that stage.  They do have patents and are currently testing the device commercially.  They need some help in the gov ready department, but that's the help they'd be looking to receive with out program.",
      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/10/25 - Call booked for 1/15/25 @ 1700 EST\n\n1/15/25 - This venture is an interesting one.  The tech has far more readiness level than his gov readiness.  The venture has created the K2 device which rapidly heals wounds, muscle injury, and muscle atrophy.  While today, the tech is ready, tested, and cleared for tech specifically with horses, they're looking to move the tech into human applications for wound healing and repair.  The founder has worked in venture capital for years, and their inaugural venture resulted in an exit to IBM in tech.  They've used their own funds (4.9 Million) to \"bootstrap\" this venture while not taking any other capital in order to maintain the largest possible equity position.  They are solely focussed on commercial use right now selling the device to show and race horse owners to fund the human clinical trials they will need to take this to the market for human use.  They have patents around the molecular tech they are using and see only about a 1 year timeline into human use with the U.S. based clinical trials being the only thing in the way as this is a Class 2 device already approved.  While the focus is for animals now, they envision the proprietary tech to be used on the battlefield or more particularly for NASA and the problem they face with atrophy of their astronauts.  I'm recommending them for an invite as they would be able to diversify the types of tech companies we're typically seeing like cyber, quantum, and cloud computing.  If this tech isn't particularly useful to INDOPACOM, it may be useful in other parts of the world, but I think they would be a good addition for defense tech.  They have VERY little if any gov readiness other than their TRL, but for a company who's tech is this far along, and incubator to get them gov ready could bring them to the level of gov readiness needed.

Their biggest challenge is navigating DOD procurement, as they are self-funded, pre-revenue, and lack government contracting credentials. However, they have a pending patent, a TRL-5 software solution, and a paid pilot in June. **Conditional approval** is recommended due to high potential but significant risks. To improve, they should secure SBIR funding, register on **SAM.gov**, acquire a **CAGE Code**, document pilot results, and engage with key DoD agencies to validate their use case.\n\nI am going to put this company through as recommended but it is largely for the potential despite their lack of traction",
      "Answer 1": "Our venture is limbic AI. And what we're trying to attempt to solve is the increase in deep fakes that are happening within the cyber security space at the moment. Right now, deepfakes are up 3,000% year over year. And this is due to artificial intelligence making it very easy to create and generate synthetic IDs and synthetic fraud. We're looking to challenge this with the introduction of biometric authentication that leverages brainwaves and neural activity, what we call the neural fingerprint. With this new paradigm and innovation, we're looking to provide a privacy preserving biometric authentication that will change the nature of how we identify and authenticate.",

And my neuroscientist lead neuroscientist is out of the University of Cambridge who's completed his PhD at the moment. Right now we are obtaining pay pilots between both the public and private sector and we've gained some traction when it comes to our initial lois that we're starting to attain between partners.",

We are targeting SBIR and STTR for an opportunity to get engaged with different agencies and public sector opportunities. We have not gone through the process of security clearance at the moment at this time as we are fairly early and in our early stages of our startup. We have Technical Readiness 5 and have achieved that through MVP and we are looking to raise that with to TRL 8 within the next three to six months. We believe we're that the government could definitely leverage our technology just based off of the advancements in artificial intelligence and the increase in uptick in deep learning attacks that are occurring at the moment right now. Look forward to working with these opportunities and these agencies as we believe we have drove in a new paradigm when it comes to authentication."

      "Phone Interview Notes": "2/18/25- Call booked for 2/19/25 at 14:30EST\n\n2/19/25- The team is developing advanced spectroscopy technology that analyzes light wavelengths to identify objects based on their atomic signature. Originally designed for telescopes, a partnership with Canon has enabled miniaturization for use in visible and infrared light. Their system has applications across defense, astronomy, medicine, agriculture, and border security. In defense, it could enhance satellite identification, missile tracking, reconnaissance, and naval monitoring. The primary challenge is funding, particularly for mold development, and securing a DoD contract. While the technology is not yet mass-producible, it is near deployment, pending government orders. With no direct competitors and unique capabilities, their venture stands out as an innovative solution. Given the distinctiveness of their approach and its potential across multiple sectors, it is recommended they be moved forward as an alternate.",
      "Answer 1": "Hello, my name is Morgan Bonet, and I'm the COO and lead engineer for hispectral. Venture is developing a new technology for what is called snapshot hyperspectral imaging. So snapshot hyperspectral imaging is basically when you do spectroscopy for every pixel in image. So for each pixel, you can obtain full spectrum of light. And so that's also called spectroscopy. So when you obtain the full spectrum of light, you can identify spectral signatures of chemical composition of objects. And that basically allows you to identify specific objects where, like with traditional imaging, three colors, you will not be able to do it. But with hyperspectral imaging, you get a lot more information, hundred, maybe thousands of colors, and that is a lot more accurate to identify objects. And for the dod, there's a lot of application in a lot of industries. But for the DoD specifically, it can help defeat camouflage, like, identify ground disturbances for, like, IDs or landmines. It can also assess ground bearing capability. If you want to send a tank into a battlefield, you want to make sure it's not going to get stuck in the mud and so on. It can be used for the security, it can be used to identify satellites or even track them by attaching a spectral signature to them and so on. So a lot of applications in the DoD and then specifically our technology helps miniaturizing existing technologies so we can do high performance systems, but in a lot smaller footprints. And so that's basically what we do.",
      "Answer 2": "In terms of traction, we've been pursuing, trying to get DAG to phase two SBIR grants, but we haven't been successful yet. We also participated in the XTEC Pacific competition. We won that competition and got about $40,000 that we've been using for patent applications. We have like three in the works right now. And then we also got money from the University of Hawaii, about $20,000, but nothing significant yet. So we're still trying to get that. On the other end, we also have a license, like an agreement with the University of Hawaii for the first patent that we developed. Because that was done at the university, they were not willing to pay for the patent. So we negotiated to be able to basically own it completely, and then we paid for it. So they're still in process. And then we are in talks with Canon in Japan. We developed that technology kind of with them. They do the manufacturing, but we own the. The patent for all the design. And so they are. We're on talks to having them basically, you know, pay for a licensing fee so they can use it and develop a more like commercial product. And we also in talks with Raytheon for maybe a Space Force project. So that's what's happening right now.",
      "Answer 3": "So my comforter and I, we are both naturalized US citizen. I'm originally from France and he's originally from Taiwan. So on that front, we can work with the government. We do not have a security clearance, but our company is already registered on SAM.gov so we have a UID number and so a CAGE number, a CAGE code, and so on. So that's really. Since we already submitted several SBI grants proposals, and you know that that was part of it. Now, in terms of contracting directly with the government, we already kind of used to that through the university. We have done some work with the Air Force and Space Force, so we know how this works, but with the company. So we were trying, like I was mentioning earlier, one option would be to develop a system for the Space Force here on Maui. We could develop a system for the telescope, and ideally we would do it in the long wave infrared. So for that, very expensive infrared detectors are needed, talking like five to $10 million a piece. So we're thinking of partnering with Raytheon, where they would be the main. And then we'll be subcontracting, doing the hardware for the hyperspectral imaging system. And then both my father and I are from the astronomy field, so very, very familiar with what we take."

      "Answer 1": "We are roboticists, but our background is in video compression. In fact, most video compression on the web today is using something called VP9, which is a compression algorithm we originally sold to Google for 130 million some time ago. The point being is that we're very familiar with video compression. We're also very familiar with drones. We're a robot company. One of our products is a low cost robot. In this particular case, we're looking at solving the problem of forward error correction when flying swarms of drones. We believe that swarms could be led by a live pilot or autonomous agent, eventually an FPV pilot, who should be able to control any one or number of different drones in that swarm dynamically, and that all the other swarm components are acting autonomously. And one of the things that we want to do is recalibrate the codec or the compression algorithm that's used to do that. Right now, nearly all the chips that are being used, including the military, using H264 and H265 compression algorithms, which are obviously optimized for YouTube. They're not optimized for flying a couple of meters above the ground and need to be optimized to do that. Needs to be chips that can do that. And there also needs to be a very low data rate communications protocol developed for swarm to swarm communications. That's a mesh network. It has to be robust, has to be low data rate. When I say robust resistance to jamming, that's part of what we want to do, is help create swarms of drones led by someone, a human being wearing goggles.",
      "Answer 2": "So far, we are six software engineers with a very strong background. We are pre seed talking to investors in our first round. Right now, we all have massive amounts of experience, not only in video compression, but also we have one extra professional first person drone pilot on our team, one of our engineers, which is why we're able to understand some of the problems that exist and solve them.",
      "Answer 3": "My name is Fabian Friedland. I'm the CEO of Bay's Edge. I previously worked for a company called Onto Technologies, which we sold to Google. My CEO at that time is the CTO of this company. His name is Dan Miller. We were on The Block Series 19 with our consumer product. I was a real estate developer for 20 years. I'm also a stand up comedian in my spare time and we really know what we're doing."

      "Video Notes": "1/20/25 - Early stage venture in ocean and air transport and surveillance, but has received a bit of funding for their proof of concept and has a team in place to further their R&D.  Good dual use argument, TRL 5, and basic gov readiness level.  Extending a call invite to learn more.",
      "Phone Interview Notes": "1/22/25 - Booked call for 1/28/25 @ 1400 EST\n\n1/28/25 - Rescheduled for 2/4/25 @ 1400 EST\n\n2/4/25 - ***FOR ALTERNATE USE ONLY*** The venture is building an autonomous hybrid ocean/air craft to carry drone swarms from point A to B.  They are VERY early stage in R&D.  Past the ideation stage with the tech but haven't quite gotten to proof of concept with their prototype yet.  They have build a 1/5th scale of what they're hoping to be their completed product and proof of concept is still a month or 2 away.  They've been decent on the BD side getting interest from many drone service providers for commercial use, but everyone wants to make sure this works before investing capital in it.  They've been bootstrapping for funding up to 140k but are looking for SBIR's once their prototype is in flight.  The prototype takes off and lands on water but flies at about 150mph in the air.  Basic gov readiness with UEI and CAGE Code but not much more than that.  Really recommending an invite here because it's innovative, and far enough in R&D where it's not just an idea, but not far enough where it's been proven yet.",
      "Answer 1": "Oh, there we go. Cool. Yeah. So tell us about venture. Problem solved, generally speaking. So basically, what we're solving is the fact that even though humans have been transporting and moving across oceans for thousands of years now, we still only have two ways of doing it, either aircraft or boats. Aircraft are very fast, but inefficient and costly. Boats are cheap, but very, very slow. And that's where ground effect vehicles come in, because they fill that gap in between them being able to offer aircraft speeds but at a fraction of the cost and CO2 emissions. Starting off, we're going to be doing smaller scale ones focused more on kind of reconnaissance, surveillance, but still possibility of transporting cargo and things like that. That's where we think a lot of really good DoD applications come in. Long term, we want to scale up to ones twice the size of a 747 so that we can revolutionize international and transoceanic cargo shipping. Because being able to offer a middle option that provides good speed, good cost effectiveness, dramatically reduces CO2 emissions and can still carry massive amounts of cargo has the potential to revolutionize how we do international cargo transport. Moving things across water, things like that. Yeah, that'll do.",
      "Answer 2": "So we're still pretty early on. Traction right now is mostly down to people we have on board. So myself, my co founder, who is a world class aerodynamics engineer, in fact, he's doing contract work for a lot of very, very big names that you've probably heard of right now, while we're in the process of still getting funds and everything together, pulled together an insane advisory board from people who worked on the B2 stealth bomber, to COO of Saildrone and a whole bunch of other fantastic, amazing people. And we're starting to have initial conversations with potential customers. So one of the use cases that we think is really interesting on the commercial side for the smaller size ones will look, see if I can get this. Yeah, kind of look like this one, but 40 foot wingspan. So think like a, basically a big ski boat with wings. One of the commercial applications we see for this is carrying drones out to remote offshore installations. So oil and gas and also wind turbines. And we're already talking to the world leader in wind turbine blade inspection using drones. And they love this idea. Their CEO is an aerospace engineer, fully gets it, fully understands it, he's on board and is even willing to kind of have conversations with potential investors talking about why they're excited about it. So yeah,",
      "Answer 3": "So as far as government ready goes, I mean we've got cage code, got all that stuff. We're already starting to do application process for STTRs. We had the benefit of that advisor who worked on the B2 stealth bomber program as an aerospace. He retired to being an aerospace engineering professor at UT Austin. So we've got a really good in with a top tier aerospace department and already having conversations with their business development division, department, whatever you want to call it. And they're on board. They think it's fantastic. They want to help out and be involved, starting that process. Now we're in the process of building the first kind of flying prototype, which will be more of an RC scale prototype. So got ducted fans, batteries, all the equipment and everything going together to get a version of that that'll be about six feet long, seven and a half foot wingspan. So that we will be at TRL 5 as opposed to just TRL 3, which is where we are now. We've done numerical analysis, computational fluid dynamics simulations and analysis and really kind of narrowed down what we want this first generation to look like that'll be going more for the dod. And so now it's starting to get it built and get kind of the smaller scale one flying."

The venture is going after a dual use case and trying to make as much traction as possible in the oil and gas industry.  They've bootstrapped the venture and received 70k in grant funding which has them at the prototype phase without full proof of concept.  Among their team, they have several members with TS clearance and their lead scientist worked for Lockheed and Raytheon.  As impressive as much of this is, I would have loved to seen more traction in the commercial space, a product that's further along, and more gov readiness.  They don't have a UEI number yet, no rev on the commercial side, and the tech is at about a TRL 4 right now.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more traction in terms of grant funding or rev and a bit more gov readiness to be a strong recommendation for an invite.

This means that personnel spend time inefficiently with manual data recording and accessing different software systems. As a result, errors in human oversight and inventory accountability, inspections, storage, transportation occur. These result in over-order or mission delays because information isn\u2019t tracked or shared well, so more supplies are bought and equipment failure factors aren\u2019t captured, increasing risk.

The current identification process for these small drones is convoluted, and there are commonly no set procedures in place. Commercial drones are used by all sides in warfare and are basically impossible to discern. As the drones are small, fast, and all look similar across the battlefield, soldiers may default to assuming the worst, resulting in potential casualties or resource wastage.\nImagine a platoon on a mission when an unidentified drone approaches rapidly. Without a clear ID system, a soldier hesitates, and the drone - an enemy unit, detonates, causing severe injuries. Alternatively, the soldier shoots it down, and that drone ends up being friendly. This is the current situation on the ground, and it is supported by numbers and data.\n1. 40% of drones Israel shot down are their own (https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-799885).\n2. The DoD recently released an SBIR topic that describes this issue perfectly.\nhttps://www.sbir.gov/node/2651333",

      "Problem Statement": "WASN addresses the critical problem of detecting, tracking, and classifying low-flying, stealthy, and kamikaze drones, which are increasingly utilized in irregular warfare tactics and represent emerging threats. These UAS evade traditional radar and RF-based detection systems and are resistant to EW, making interception challenging. This calls for cost-effective acoustic sensing technologies for early warning capabilities in contested EM environments, where conventional systems often fail. By overcoming these challenges, our technology significantly enhances defense mechanisms against advanced aerial threats in modern combat scenarios.",

      "Problem Statement": "Wireless systems are primarily limited by jammers. This is especially true for wideband systems and radars, where the probability of encountering an interferer, intentional or accidental, is high. In the commercial world, this stems from the congested available electromagnetic spectrum. For example, in several airports within the USA, commercial aviation altimeter radars were jammed by newly deployed 5G base stations. From a defense perspective, adversarial jamming of communications and GPS (currently witnessed in several eastern European countries) is impeding numerous defense operations. Self-jamming is also highly probable in the presence of multiple co-located electromagnetic emitters.\n",

      "Problem Statement": "In the commercial sector, seaplanes (aircraft that can take off and land on water) are the fastest and most convenient form of coastal regional mobility, but current seaplanes face high fuel burn and corrosion-related maintenance. These high operating costs limit growth in seaplane aviation. Polaris reduces fuel burn by 85% and nearly eliminates corrosion-related maintenance, enabling airlines to make seaplanes mainstream transportation. In defense applications, our aircraft supports the growing DOD focus on distributed operations, providing a flexible and infrastructure-light solution for runway-independence. Further, Polaris brings a low logistics footprint, reducing the burden of supporting a network of dispersed bases.",
      "Value Proposition": "We are developing Polaris, a hybrid-electric aircraft with a maximum payload of 3120 lb capable of takeoff and landing from both water and land that provides runway-independent capability with far lower complexity, fuel needs, and maintenance support than vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL) solutions.",

Decision makers currently rely on slow manual processes and distributed systems of experts when gathering information during the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).

This deficiency means major decisions are made more slowly and with less information than the tempo of today\u2019s information environment demands. ",

The future environment requires not only best-in-class autonomous vehicles, but also a focused effort on vendor-agnostic UxS interplay and collaboration. More specifically, the orchestration systems must invest in best-in-class collaboration and consensus algorithms.\n\nWhile there are ongoing efforts in 1:1 or 1:Many control systems, middle-ware, and ground control stations, there are few multi-agent orchestration platforms.\n\nThere is an over-reliance on exquisite, high demand sensors. An agent-agnostic orchestration framework allows for novel distributed sensing algorithms that can produce greater data bi-products collectively than any singular exquisite sensor.\n",
