## Project Vision

This project is evolving from a DoD SBIR/STTR scraping tool into a comprehensive **AI Copilot for Defense Industry Contract Opportunities**. The system will provide intelligent opportunity matching and insights for defense contractors.

### Strategic Roadmap

**Current State**: DoD SBIR/STTR data extraction and analysis
**Phase 1**: AI-powered opportunity matching using business profiles from iME
**Phase 2**: Intelligent agent with proposal assistance and market insights
**Phase 3**: Comprehensive defense contracting copilot across all contract types

### Integration with iME (Integrated Modernization Environment)

This tool receives business profile data from the adjacent **iME project**, which handles:
- Business profile capture and management
- Company capability databases
- Contractor information and certifications

This project focuses on:
- Opportunity intelligence and analysis
- AI-powered matching algorithms
- Market insights and recommendations
- Proposal assistance (future)

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of three main layers with planned AI integration:

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **Tech Stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Material-UI, Bootstrap
- **Key Components**: 
  - `TopicsTable.tsx` - Main data display with filtering/sorting
  - `FilterPanel.tsx` - Advanced filtering controls
  - `TopicDetailModal.tsx` - Detailed topic view
  - `PaginationControls.tsx` - Data pagination
- **State Management**: Context API (`FilterContext.tsx`) + custom hooks (`useFilters.ts`)
- **Data Flow**: Frontend calls Express API â†’ Backend executes Python scraping â†’ Results displayed

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **Entry Point**: `server.js` - Express server with CORS, serves React build
- **APIs**: RESTful endpoints for triggering scrapes and fetching data
- **Port Configuration**: Backend runs on 3001, frontend dev server on 5173
- **Static Serving**: Serves built React app from `/frontend/dist`

### Python Scraping Layer
- **Main Script**: `script.py` - Playwright-based browser automation
- **Browser Config**: Chromium with minimal flags for Railway deployment
- **Data Sources**: DoD SBIR/STTR topics database at dodsbirsttr.mil
- **Discovery Scripts**: Separate utilities for exploring API endpoints and filters
- **Output**: JSON data files and PDF downloads in `/downloads`

### Data Storage
- **Configuration**: `filters.json` - Available filter options
- **Downloads**: `/downloads` directory for scraped PDFs and data
- **Session State**: Frontend maintains filter/pagination state in context

## Key Development Patterns

### Component Communication
- Props drilling for simple data passing
- Context API for cross-component state (filters, selections)
- Custom hooks for reusable logic (filtering, data fetching)

### Error Handling
- Backend: Express error middleware with detailed logging
- Frontend: Try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
- Python: Playwright timeout and retry mechanisms

### Browser Automation Flow
1. Launch Playwright browser with minimal configuration
2. Navigate to DoD SBIR/STTR site
3. Handle dynamic content loading with explicit waits
4. Extract structured data from search results
5. Download PDFs and save metadata

### Performance Considerations
- Frontend pagination to handle large datasets
- Backend rate limiting for API calls
- Python script uses single browser instance with context reuse
- Minimal Playwright browser flags for cloud deployment
